New plays and maidenheads are near akin:Much followed both, for both much money giv’n,If they stand sound and well. And a good play,Whose modest scenes blush on his marriage dayAnd shake to lose his honor, is like herThat after holy tie and first night’s stirYet still is modesty, and still retainsMore of the maid, to sight, than husband’s pains.We pray our play may be so, for I am sureIt has a noble breeder and a pure,A learnèd, and a poet never wentMore famous yet ’twixt Po and silver Trent.Chaucer, of all admired, the story gives;There, constant to eternity, it lives.If we let fall the nobleness of this,And the first sound this child hear be a hiss,How will it shake the bones of that good manAnd make him cry from underground O, fanFrom me the witless chaff of such a writerThat blasts my bays and my famed works makeslighterThan Robin Hood! This is the fear we bring;For, to say truth, it were an endless thingAnd too ambitious, to aspire to him,Weak as we are, and, almost breathless, swimIn this deep water. Do but you hold outYour helping hands, and we shall tack aboutAnd something do to save us. You shall hearScenes, though below his art, may yet appearWorth two hours’ travel. To his bones sweet sleep;Content to you. If this play do not keepA little dull time from us, we perceiveOur losses fall so thick we must needs leave.
Roses, their sharp spines being gone,Not royal in their smells alone,But in their hue;Maiden pinks, of odor faint,Daisies smell-less, yet most quaint,And sweet thyme true;Primrose, firstborn child of Ver,Merry springtime’s harbinger,With her bells dim;Oxlips in their cradles growing,Marigolds on deathbeds blowing,Lark’s-heels trim;All dear Nature’s children sweetLie ’fore bride and bridegroom’s feet,Blessing their sense.Not an angel of the air,Bird melodious or bird fair,Is absent hence.The crow, the sland’rous cuckoo, norThe boding raven, nor chough hoar,Nor chatt’ring pie,May on our bridehouse perch or sing,Or with them any discord bring,But from it fly.
For pity’s sake and true gentility’s,Hear and respect me.
For your mother’s sake,And as you wish your womb may thrive with fairones,Hear and respect me.
Now for the love of him whom Jove hath markedThe honor of your bed, and for the sakeOf clear virginity, be advocateFor us and our distresses. This good deedShall raze you out o’ th’ book of trespassesAll you are set down there.
Sad lady, rise.
Stand up.
No knees to me.What woman I may stead that is distressedDoes bind me to her.
What’s your request? Deliver you for all.
We are three queens whose sovereigns fell beforeThe wrath of cruel Creon; who enduredThe beaks of ravens, talons of the kites,And pecks of crows in the foul fields of Thebes.He will not suffer us to burn their bones,To urn their ashes, nor to take th’ offenseOf mortal loathsomeness from the blest eyeOf holy Phoebus, but infects the windsWith stench of our slain lords. O, pity, duke!Thou purger of the Earth, draw thy feared swordThat does good turns to th’ world; give us the bonesOf our dead kings, that we may chapel them;And of thy boundless goodness take some noteThat for our crownèd heads we have no roofSave this, which is the lion’s and the bear’s,And vault to everything.
Pray you, kneel not.I was transported with your speech and sufferedYour knees to wrong themselves. I have heard thefortunesOf your dead lords, which gives me such lamentingAs wakes my vengeance and revenge for ’em.King Capaneus was your lord. The dayThat he should marry you, at such a seasonAs now it is with me, I met your groomBy Mars’s altar. You were that time fair—Not Juno’s mantle fairer than your tresses,Nor in more bounty spread her. Your wheatenwreathWas then nor threshed nor blasted. Fortune at youDimpled her cheek with smiles. Hercules, ourkinsman,Then weaker than your eyes, laid by his club;He tumbled down upon his Nemean hideAnd swore his sinews thawed. O grief and time,Fearful consumers, you will all devour!
O, I hope some god,Some god hath put his mercy in your manhood,Whereto he’ll infuse power, and press you forthOur undertaker.
O, no knees, none, widow!Unto the helmeted Bellona use themAnd pray for me, your soldier.Troubled I am.
Honored Hippolyta,Most dreaded Amazonian, that hast slainThe scythe-tusked boar; that with thy arm, as strongAs it is white, wast near to make the maleTo thy sex captive, but that this thy lord,Born to uphold creation in that honorFirst nature styled it in, shrunk thee intoThe bound thou wast o’erflowing, at once subduingThy force and thy affection; soldieressThat equally canst poise sternness with pity,Whom now I know hast much more power on himThan ever he had on thee, who ow’st his strengthAnd his love too, who is a servant forThe tenor of thy speech, dear glass of ladies,Bid him that we, whom flaming war doth scorch,Under the shadow of his sword may cool us;Require him he advance it o’er our heads;Speak ’t in a woman’s key, like such a womanAs any of us three; weep ere you fail.Lend us a knee;But touch the ground for us no longer timeThan a dove’s motion when the head’s plucked off.Tell him if he i’ th’ blood-sized field lay swoll’n,Showing the sun his teeth, grinning at the moon,What you would do.
Poor lady, say no more.I had as lief trace this good action with youAs that whereto I am going, and never yetWent I so willing way. My lord is takenHeart-deep with your distress; let him consider.I’ll speak anon.
O, my petition wasSet down in ice, which by hot grief uncandiedMelts into drops; so sorrow, wanting form,Is pressed with deeper matter.
Pray stand up.Your grief is written in your cheek.
O, woe!You cannot read it there.There through my tears,Like wrinkled pebbles in a glassy stream,You may behold ’em. Lady, lady, alack!He that will all the treasure know o’ th’ EarthMust know the center too; he that will fishFor my least minnow, let him lead his lineTo catch one at my heart. O, pardon me!Extremity, that sharpens sundry wits,Makes me a fool.
Pray you say nothing, pray you.Who cannot feel nor see the rain, being in ’t,Knows neither wet nor dry. If that you wereThe groundpiece of some painter, I would buy youT’ instruct me ’gainst a capital grief—indeed,Such heart-pierced demonstration. But, alas,Being a natural sister of our sex,Your sorrow beats so ardently upon meThat it shall make a counter-reflect ’gainstMy brother’s heart and warm it to some pity,Though it were made of stone. Pray have goodcomfort.
Forward to th’ temple. Leave not out a jotO’ th’ sacred ceremony.
O, this celebrationWill longer last and be more costly thanYour suppliants’ war. Remember that your fameKnolls in the ear o’ th’ world; what you do quicklyIs not done rashly; your first thought is moreThan others’ labored meditance, your premeditatingMore than their actions. But, O Jove, your actions,Soon as they move, as ospreys do the fish,Subdue before they touch. Think, dear duke, thinkWhat beds our slain kings have!
What griefs our beds,That our dear lords have none!
None fit for th’ dead.Those that with cords, knives, drams, precipitance,Weary of this world’s light, have to themselvesBeen death’s most horrid agents, human graceAffords them dust and shadow.
But our lordsLie blist’ring ’fore the visitating sun,And were good kings when living.
It is true, and I will give you comfortTo give your dead lords graves;The which to do must make some work with Creon.
And that work presents itself to th’ doing.Now ’twill take form; the heats are gone tomorrow.Then, bootless toil must recompense itselfWith its own sweat. Now he’s secure,Not dreams we stand before your puissance,Rinsing our holy begging in our eyesTo make petition clear.
Now you may take him,Drunk with his victory.
And his army fullOf bread and sloth.
Artesius, that best knowestHow to draw out, fit to this enterprise,The prim’st for this proceeding, and the numberTo carry such a business: forth and levyOur worthiest instruments, whilst we dispatchThis grand act of our life, this daring deedOf fate in wedlock.
Dowagers, take hands.Let us be widows to our woes. DelayCommends us to a famishing hope.
Farewell.
We come unseasonably; but when could griefCull forth, as unpanged judgment can, fitt’st timeFor best solicitation?
Why, good ladies,This is a service whereto I am goingGreater than any was; it more imports meThan all the actions that I have foregone,Or futurely can cope.
The more proclaimingOur suit shall be neglected when her arms,Able to lock Jove from a synod, shallBy warranting moonlight corselet thee. O, whenHer twinning cherries shall their sweetness fallUpon thy tasteful lips, what wilt thou thinkOf rotten kings or blubbered queens? What careFor what thou feel’st not, what thou feel’st beingableTo make Mars spurn his drum? O, if thou couchBut one night with her, every hour in ’t willTake hostage of thee for a hundred, andThou shalt remember nothing more than whatThat banquet bids thee to.
Though much unlikeYou should be so transported, as much sorryI should be such a suitor, yet I thinkDid I not, by th’ abstaining of my joy—Which breeds a deeper longing—cure their surfeitThat craves a present med’cine, I should pluckAll ladies’ scandal on me.Therefore, sir,As I shall here make trial of my prayers,Either presuming them to have some force,Or sentencing for aye their vigor dumb,Prorogue this business we are going about, andhangYour shield afore your heart—about that neckWhich is my fee, and which I freely lendTo do these poor queens service.
O, help now!Our cause cries for your knee.
If you grant notMy sister her petition in that force,With that celerity and nature whichShe makes it in, from henceforth I’ll not dareTo ask you anything, nor be so hardyEver to take a husband.
Pray stand up.I am entreating of myself to doThat which you kneel to have me.—Pirithous,Lead on the bride; get you and pray the godsFor success and return; omit not anythingIn the pretended celebration.—Queens,Follow your soldier. As before, henceyou,And at the banks of Aulis meet us withThe forces you can raise, where we shall findThe moiety of a number for a businessMore bigger looked.Since that our theme is haste,I stamp this kiss upon thy currant lip;Sweet, keep it as my token.—Set you forward,For I will see you gone.Farewell, my beauteous sister.—Pirithous,Keep the feast full; bate not an hour on ’t.
Sir,I’ll follow you at heels. The feast’s solemnityShall want till your return.
Cousin, I charge you,Budge not from Athens. We shall be returningEre you can end this feast, of which I pray youMake no abatement.—Once more, farewell all.
Thus dost thou still make good the tongue o’ th’world.
And earn’st a deity equal with Mars.
If not above him, forThou, being but mortal, makest affections bendTo godlike honors; they themselves, some say,Groan under such a mast’ry.
As we are men,Thus should we do; being sensually subdued,We lose our human title. Good cheer, ladies.Now turn we towards your comforts.
Dear Palamon, dearer in love than bloodAnd our prime cousin, yet unhardened inThe crimes of nature, let us leave the cityThebes, and the temptings in ’t, before we furtherSully our gloss of youth,And here to keep in abstinence we shameAs in incontinence; for not to swimI’ th’ aid o’ th’ current were almost to sink,At least to frustrate striving; and to followThe common stream, ’twould bring us to an eddyWhere we should turn or drown; if labor through,Our gain but life and weakness.
Your adviceIs cried up with example. What strange ruins,Since first we went to school, may we perceiveWalking in Thebes! Scars and bare weedsThe gain o’ th’ martialist, who did propoundTo his bold ends honor and golden ingots,Which though he won, he had not, and now flirtedBy peace for whom he fought. Who then shall offerTo Mars’s so-scorned altar? I do bleedWhen such I meet, and wish great Juno wouldResume her ancient fit of jealousyTo get the soldier work, that peace might purgeFor her repletion, and retain anewHer charitable heart, now hard and harsherThan strife or war could be.
Are you not out?Meet you no ruin but the soldier inThe cranks and turns of Thebes? You did beginAs if you met decays of many kinds.Perceive you none that do arouse your pityBut th’ unconsidered soldier?
Yes, I pityDecays where’er I find them, but such mostThat, sweating in an honorable toil,Are paid with ice to cool ’em.
’Tis not thisI did begin to speak of. This is virtueOf no respect in Thebes. I spake of Thebes—How dangerous, if we will keep our honors,It is for our residing, where every evilHath a good color; where every seeming good’sA certain evil; where not to be e’en jumpAs they are here were to be strangers, and,Such things to be, mere monsters.
’Tis in our power—Unless we fear that apes can tutor ’s—toBe masters of our manners. What need IAffect another’s gait, which is not catchingWhere there is faith? Or to be fond uponAnother’s way of speech, when by mine ownI may be reasonably conceived—saved too,Speaking it truly? Why am I boundBy any generous bond to follow himFollows his tailor, haply so long untilThe followed make pursuit? Or let me knowWhy mine own barber is unblessed, with himMy poor chin too, for ’tis not scissored justTo such a favorite’s glass? What canon is thereThat does command my rapier from my hipTo dangle ’t in my hand, or to go tiptoeBefore the street be foul? Either I amThe forehorse in the team, or I am noneThat draw i’ th’ sequent trace. These poor slightsoresNeed not a plantain. That which rips my bosomAlmost to th’ heart’s—
Our Uncle Creon.
He.A most unbounded tyrant, whose successesMakes heaven unfeared and villainy assuredBeyond its power there’s nothing; almost putsFaith in a fever, and deifies aloneVoluble chance; who only attributesThe faculties of other instrumentsTo his own nerves and act; commands men service,And what they win in ’t, boot and glory; oneThat fears not to do harm; good, dares not. LetThe blood of mine that’s sib to him be suckedFrom me with leeches; let them break and fallOff me with that corruption.
Clear-spirited cousin,Let’s leave his court, that we may nothing shareOf his loud infamy; for our milkWill relish of the pasture, and we mustBe vile or disobedient, not his kinsmenIn blood unless in quality.
Nothing truer.I think the echoes of his shames have deafedThe ears of heav’nly justice. Widows’ criesDescend again into their throats and have notDue audience of the gods.Valerius.
The King calls for you; yet be leaden-footedTill his great rage be off him. Phoebus, whenHe broke his whipstock and exclaimed againstThe horses of the sun, but whispered toThe loudness of his fury.
Small winds shake him.But what’s the matter?
Theseus, who where he threats appalls, hath sentDeadly defiance to him and pronouncesRuin to Thebes, who is at hand to sealThe promise of his wrath.
Let him approach.But that we fear the gods in him, he brings notA jot of terror to us. Yet what manThirds his own worth—the case is each of ours—When that his action’s dregged with mind assured’Tis bad he goes about?
Leave that unreasoned.Our services stand now for Thebes, not Creon.Yet to be neutral to him were dishonor,Rebellious to oppose. Therefore we mustWith him stand to the mercy of our fate,Who hath bounded our last minute.
So we must.Is ’t said this war’s afoot? Or, it shallbe,On fail of some condition?
’Tis in motion;The intelligence of state came in the instantWith the defier.
Let’s to the King, who, were heA quarter carrier of that honor whichHis enemy come in, the blood we ventureShould be as for our health, which were not spent,Rather laid out for purchase. But alas,Our hands advanced before our hearts, what willThe fall o’ th’ stroke do damage?
Let th’ event,That never-erring arbitrator, tell usWhen we know all ourselves, and let us followThe becking of our chance.
No further.
Sir, farewell. Repeat my wishesTo our great lord, of whose success I dare notMake any timorous question; yet I wish himExcess and overflow of power, an ’t might be,To dure ill-dealing fortune. Speed to him.Store never hurts good governors.
Though I knowHis ocean needs not my poor drops, yet theyMust yield their tribute there.—My precious maid,Those best affections that the heavens infuseIn their best-tempered pieces keep enthronedIn your dear heart!
Thanks, sir. Remember meTo our all-royal brother, for whose speedThe great Bellona I’ll solicit; andSince in our terrene state petitions are notWithout gifts understood, I’ll offer to herWhat I shall be advised she likes. Our heartsAre in his army, in his tent.
In ’s bosom.We have been soldiers, and we cannot weepWhen our friends don their helms or put to sea,Or tell of babes broached on the lance, or womenThat have sod their infants in—and after ate them—The brine they wept at killing ’em. Then ifYou stay to see of us such spinsters, weShould hold you here forever.
Peace be to youAs I pursue this war, which shall be thenBeyond further requiring.
How his longingFollows his friend! Since his depart, his sports,Though craving seriousness and skill, passed slightlyHis careless execution, where nor gainMade him regard, or loss consider, butPlaying one business in his hand, anotherDirecting in his head, his mind nurse equalTo these so diff’ring twins. Have you observed himSince our great lord departed?
With much labor,And I did love him for ’t. They two have cabinedIn many as dangerous as poor a corner,Peril and want contending; they have skiffedTorrents whose roaring tyranny and powerI’ th’ least of these was dreadful, and they haveFought out together where Death’s self was lodged.Yet fate hath brought them off. Their knot of love,Tied, weaved, entangled, with so true, so long,And with a finger of so deep a cunning,May be outworn, never undone. I thinkTheseus cannot be umpire to himself,Cleaving his conscience into twain and doingEach side like justice, which he loves best.
DoubtlessThere is a best, and reason has no mannersTo say it is not you. I was acquaintedOnce with a time when I enjoyed a playfellow;You were at wars when she the grave enriched,Who made too proud the bed; took leave o’ th’ moon,Which then looked pale at parting, when our countWas each eleven.
’Twas Flavina.
Yes.You talk of Pirithous’ and Theseus’ love.Theirs has more ground, is more maturely seasoned,More buckled with strong judgment, and their needsThe one of th’ other may be said to waterTheir intertangled roots of love. But I,And she I sigh and spoke of, were things innocent,Loved for we did, and like the elementsThat know not what nor why, yet do effectRare issues by their operance, our soulsDid so to one another. What she likedWas then of me approved, what not, condemned,No more arraignment. The flower that I would pluckAnd put between my breasts—O, then but beginningTo swell about the blossom—she would longTill she had such another, and commit itTo the like innocent cradle, where, Phoenix-like,They died in perfume. On my head no toyBut was her pattern; her affections—pretty,Though haply hers careless were—I followedFor my most serious decking. Had mine earStol’n some new air, or at adventure hummed oneFrom musical coinage, why, it was a noteWhereon her spirits would sojourn—rather, dwellon—And sing it in her slumbers. This rehearsal—Which fury-innocent wots well comes inLike old importment’s bastard—has this end,That the true love ’tween maid and maid may beMore than in sex individual.
You’re out of breath,And this high-speeded pace is but to sayThat you shall never—like the maid Flavina—Love any that’s called man.
I am sure I shall not.
Now, alack, weak sister,I must no more believe thee in this point—Though in ’t I know thou dost believe thyself—Than I will trust a sickly appetite,That loathes even as it longs. But sure, my sister,If I were ripe for your persuasion, youHave said enough to shake me from the armOf the all-noble Theseus, for whose fortunesI will now in and kneel, with great assuranceThat we, more than his Pirithous, possessThe high throne in his heart.
I am notAgainst your faith, yet I continue mine.
To thee no star be dark!
Both heaven and EarthFriend thee forever.
All the good that mayBe wished upon thy head, I cry Amen to ’t!
Th’ impartial gods, who from the mounted heavensView us their mortal herd, behold who errAnd, in their time, chastise. Go and find outThe bones of your dead lords and honor themWith treble ceremony; rather than a gapShould be in their dear rites, we would supply ’t;But those we will depute which shall investYou in your dignities and even each thingOur haste does leave imperfect. So, adieu,And heaven’s good eyes look on you.What are those?
Men of great quality, as may be judgedBy their appointment. Some of Thebes have told ’sThey are sisters’ children, nephews to the King.
By th’ helm of Mars, I saw them in the war,Like to a pair of lions, smeared with prey,Make lanes in troops aghast. I fixed my noteConstantly on them, for they were a markWorth a god’s view. What prisoner was ’t that told meWhen I enquired their names?
Wi’ leave, they’re calledArcite and Palamon.
’Tis right; those, those.They are not dead?
Nor in a state of life. Had they been takenWhen their last hurts were given, ’twas possibleThey might have been recovered. Yet they breatheAnd have the name of men.
Then like men use ’em.The very lees of such, millions of rates,Exceed the wine of others. All our surgeonsConvent in their behoof; our richest balms,Rather than niggard, waste. Their lives concern usMuch more than Thebes is worth. Rather than have’emFreed of this plight, and in their morning state,Sound and at liberty, I would ’em dead.But forty-thousandfold we had rather have ’emPrisoners to us than Death. Bear ’em speedilyFrom our kind air, to them unkind, and ministerWhat man to man may do—for our sake, more,Since I have known frights, fury, friends’ behests,Love’s provocations, zeal, a mistress’ task,Desire of liberty, a fever, madness,Hath set a mark which nature could not reach toWithout some imposition, sickness in willO’er-wrestling strength in reason. For our loveAnd great Apollo’s mercy, all our bestTheir best skill tender.—Lead into the city,Where, having bound things scattered, we will postTo Athens ’fore our army.
Urns and odors bring away;Vapors, sighs, darken the day;Our dole more deadly looks than dying;Balms and gums and heavy cheers,Sacred vials filled with tears,And clamors through the wild air flying.Come, all sad and solemn showsThat are quick-eyed Pleasure’s foes;We convent naught else but woes.We convent naught else but woes.
This funeral path brings to your household’s grave.Joy seize on you again; peace sleep with him.
And this to yours.
Yours this way. HeavenslendA thousand differing ways to one sure end.
This world’s a city full of straying streets,And death’s the market-place where each one meets.
I may depart with little while I live; something Imay cast to you, not much. Alas, the prison I keep,though it be for great ones, yet they seldom come;before one salmon you shall take a number of minnows.I am given out to be better lined than it canappear to me report is a true speaker. I would Iwere really that I am delivered to be. Marry, whatI have, be it what it will, I will assure upon mydaughter at the day of my death.
Sir, I demand no more than your own offer,and I will estate your daughter in what I havepromised.
Well, we will talk more of this when the solemnityis past. But have you a full promise of her?When that shall be seen, I tender my consent.
I have sir. Here she comes.
Your friend and I have chancedto name you here, upon the old business. But nomore of that now; so soon as the court hurry isover, we will have an end of it. I’ th’ meantime,look tenderly to the two prisoners. I can tell youthey are princes.
These strewings are for their chamber. ’Tispity they are in prison, and ’twere pity they shouldbe out. I do think they have patience to make anyadversity ashamed. The prison itself is proud of’em, and they have all the world in their chamber.
They are famed to be a pair of absolute men.
By my troth, I think fame but stammers’em. They stand a grise above the reach of report.
I heard them reported in the battle to be theonly doers.
Nay, most likely, for they are noble suff’rers.I marvel how they would have looked had theybeen victors, that with such a constant nobility enforcea freedom out of bondage, making miserytheir mirth and affliction a toy to jest at.
Do they so?
It seems to me they have no more senseof their captivity than I of ruling Athens. They eatwell, look merrily, discourse of many things, butnothing of their own restraint and disasters. Yetsometimes a divided sigh, martyred as ’twere i’ th’deliverance, will break from one of them—whenthe other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke thatI could wish myself a sigh to be so chid, or at leasta sigher to be comforted.
I never saw ’em.
The Duke himself came privately in the night,and so did they.What the reason of it is, I know not. Look, yonderthey are; that’s Arcite looks out.
No, sir, no, that’s Palamon. Arcite is thelower of the twain; you may perceive a part ofhim.
Go to, leave your pointing; they would notmake us their object. Out of their sight.
It is a holiday to look on them. Lord, thediff’rence of men!
How do you, noble cousin?
How do you, sir?
Why, strong enough to laugh at miseryAnd bear the chance of war; yet we are prisonersI fear forever, cousin.
I believe it,And to that destiny have patientlyLaid up my hour to come.
O, cousin Arcite,Where is Thebes now? Where is our noble country?Where are our friends and kindreds? Never moreMust we behold those comforts, never seeThe hardy youths strive for the games of honor,Hung with the painted favors of their ladies,Like tall ships under sail; then start amongst ’emAnd as an east wind leave ’em all behind us,Like lazy clouds, whilst Palamon and Arcite,Even in the wagging of a wanton leg,Outstripped the people’s praises, won the garlandsEre they have time to wish ’em ours. O, neverShall we two exercise, like twins of honor,Our arms again, and feel our fiery horsesLike proud seas under us. Our good swords now—Better the red-eyed god of war ne’er wore—Ravished our sides, like age must run to rustAnd deck the temples of those gods that hate us;These hands shall never draw ’em out like lightningTo blast whole armies more.
No, Palamon,Those hopes are prisoners with us. Here we areAnd here the graces of our youths must witherLike a too-timely spring. Here age must find usAnd—which is heaviest, Palamon—unmarried.The sweet embraces of a loving wife,Loaden with kisses, armed with thousand Cupids,Shall never clasp our necks; no issue know us—No figures of ourselves shall we e’er see,To glad our age, and like young eagles teach ’emBoldly to gaze against bright arms and sayRemember what your fathers were, and conquer!The fair-eyed maids shall weep our banishmentsAnd in their songs curse ever-blinded FortuneTill she for shame see what a wrong she has doneTo youth and nature. This is all our world.We shall know nothing here but one another,Hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes.The vine shall grow, but we shall never see it;Summer shall come, and with her all delights,But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still.
’Tis too true, Arcite. To our Theban houndsThat shook the agèd forest with their echoesNo more now must we halloo; no more shakeOur pointed javelins whilst the angry swineFlies like a Parthian quiver from our rages,Struck with our well-steeled darts. All valiant uses,The food and nourishment of noble minds,In us two here shall perish; we shall die,Which is the curse of honor, lastly,Children of grief and ignorance.
Yet, cousin,Even from the bottom of these miseries,From all that fortune can inflict upon us,I see two comforts rising, two mere blessings,If the gods please: to hold here a brave patience,And the enjoying of our griefs together.Whilst Palamon is with me, let me perishIf I think this our prison!
Certainly’Tis a main goodness, cousin, that our fortunesWere twined together. ’Tis most true, two soulsPut in two noble bodies, let ’em sufferThe gall of hazard, so they grow together,Will never sink; they must not, say they could.A willing man dies sleeping and all’s done.
Shall we make worthy uses of this placeThat all men hate so much?
How, gentle cousin?
Let’s think this prison holy sanctuaryTo keep us from corruption of worse men.We are young and yet desire the ways of honorThat liberty and common conversation,The poison of pure spirits, might like womenWoo us to wander from. What worthy blessingCan be but our imaginationsMay make it ours? And here being thus together,We are an endless mine to one another;We are one another’s wife, ever begettingNew births of love; we are father, friends,acquaintance;We are, in one another, families;I am your heir, and you are mine. This placeIs our inheritance; no hard oppressorDare take this from us; here with a little patienceWe shall live long and loving. No surfeits seek us;The hand of war hurts none here, nor the seasSwallow their youth. Were we at liberty,A wife might part us lawfully, or business;Quarrels consume us; envy of ill menCrave our acquaintance. I might sicken, cousin,Where you should never know it, and so perishWithout your noble hand to close mine eyes,Or prayers to the gods. A thousand chances,Were we from hence, would sever us.
You have mademe—I thank you, cousin Arcite—almost wantonWith my captivity. What a miseryIt is to live abroad and everywhere!’Tis like a beast, methinks. I find the court here,I am sure, a more content; and all those pleasuresThat woo the wills of men to vanityI see through now, and am sufficientTo tell the world ’tis but a gaudy shadowThat old Time as he passes by takes with him.What had we been, old in the court of Creon,Where sin is justice, lust and ignoranceThe virtues of the great ones? Cousin Arcite,Had not the loving gods found this place for us,We had died as they do, ill old men, unwept,And had their epitaphs, the people’s curses.Shall I say more?
I would hear you still.
You shall.Is there record of any two that lovedBetter than we do, Arcite?
Sure there cannot.
I do not think it possible our friendshipShould ever leave us.
Till our deaths it cannot.And after death our spirits shall be ledTo those that love eternally.Speak on, sir.
This garden has a world of pleasures in ’t.What flower is this?
’Tis called narcissus, madam.
That was a fair boy certain, but a foolTo love himself. Were there not maids enough?
Pray, forward.
Yes.
Or were they all hard-hearted?
They could not be to one so fair.
Thou wouldst not.
I think I should not, madam.
That’s a good wench.But take heed to your kindness, though.
Why,madam?
Men are mad things.
Will you go forward,cousin?
Canst not thou work such flowers in silk, wench?
Yes.
I’ll have a gown full of ’em, and of these.This is pretty color. Will ’t not doRarely upon a skirt, wench?
Dainty, madam.
Cousin, cousin! How do you, sir? Why, Palamon!
Never till now I was in prison, Arcite.
Why, what’s the matter, man?
Behold, and wonder!By heaven, she is a goddess.
Ha!
Do reverence.She is a goddess, Arcite.
Of all flowersMethinks a rose is best.
Why, gentle madam?
It is the very emblem of a maid.For when the west wind courts her gently,How modestly she blows and paints the sunWith her chaste blushes! When the north comesnear her,Rude and impatient, then, like chastity,She locks her beauties in her bud again,And leaves him to base briers.
Yet, good madam,Sometimes her modesty will blow so farShe falls for ’t. A maid,If she have any honor, would be loathTo take example by her.
Thou art wanton!
She is wondrous fair.
She is all the beauty extant.
The sun grows high. Let’s walk in. Keep theseflowers.We’ll see how near art can come near their colors.I am wondrous merry-hearted. I could laugh now.
I could lie down, I am sure.
And take one with you?
That’s as we bargain, madam.
Well, agree then.
What think you of this beauty?
’Tis a rare one.
Is ’t but a rare one?
Yes, a matchless beauty.
Might not a man well lose himself and love her?
I cannot tell what you have done; I have,Beshrew mine eyes for ’t! Now I feel my shackles.
You love her, then?
Who would not?
And desire her?
Before my liberty.
I saw her first.
That’s nothing.
But it shall be.
I saw her, too.
Yes, but you must not love her.
I will not, as you do, to worship herAs she is heavenly and a blessèd goddess.I love her as a woman, to enjoy her.So both may love.
You shall not love at all.
Not love at all! Who shall deny me?
I, that first saw her; I that took possessionFirst with mine eye of all those beautiesIn her revealed to mankind. If thou lov’st her,Or entertain’st a hope to blast my wishes,Thou art a traitor, Arcite, and a fellowFalse as thy title to her. Friendship, blood,And all the ties between us I disclaimIf thou once think upon her.
Yes, I love her,And, if the lives of all my name lay on it,I must do so. I love her with my soul.If that will lose you, farewell, Palamon.I say again, I love, and in loving her maintainI am as worthy and as free a loverAnd have as just a title to her beautyAs any Palamon or any livingThat is a man’s son.
Have I called thee friend?
Yes, and have found me so. Why are you movedthus?Let me deal coldly with you: am not IPart of your blood, part of your soul? You havetold meThat I was Palamon and you were Arcite.
Yes.
Am not I liable to those affections,Those joys, griefs, angers, fears, my friend shallsuffer?
You may be.
Why then would you deal so cunningly,So strangely, so unlike a noble kinsman,To love alone? Speak truly, do you think meUnworthy of her sight?
No, but unjustIf thou pursue that sight.
Because anotherFirst sees the enemy, shall I stand stillAnd let mine honor down, and never charge?
Yes, if he be but one.
But say that oneHad rather combat me?
Let that one say so,And use thy freedom. Else, if thou pursuest her,Be as that cursèd man that hates his country,A branded villain.
You are mad.
I must be.Till thou art worthy, Arcite, it concerns me.And in this madness if I hazard theeAnd take thy life, I deal but truly.
Fie, sir!You play the child extremely. I will love her;I must, I ought to do so, and I dare,And all this justly.
O, that now, that now,Thy false self and thy friend had but this fortuneTo be one hour at liberty, and graspOur good swords in our hands, I would quicklyteach theeWhat ’twere to filch affection from another.Thou art baser in it than a cutpurse.Put but thy head out of this window moreAnd, as I have a soul, I’ll nail thy life to ’t.
Thou dar’st not, fool; thou canst not; thou art feeble.Put my head out? I’ll throw my body outAnd leap the garden when I see her next,And pitch between her arms to anger thee.
No more; the keeper’s coming. I shall liveTo knock thy brains out with my shackles.
Do!
By your leave, gentlemen.
Now, honest keeper?
Lord Arcite, you must presently to th’ Duke;The cause I know not yet.
I am ready, keeper.
Prince Palamon, I must awhile bereave youOf your fair cousin’s company.
And me too,Even when you please, of life.—Why is he sent for?It may be he shall marry her; he’s goodly,And like enough the Duke hath taken noticeBoth of his blood and body. But his falsehood!Why should a friend be treacherous? If thatGet him a wife so noble and so fair,Let honest men ne’er love again. Once moreI would but see this fair one. Blessèd gardenAnd fruit and flowers more blessèd that stillblossomAs her bright eyes shine on you, would I were,For all the fortune of my life hereafter,Yon little tree, yon blooming apricock!How I would spread and fling my wanton armsIn at her window; I would bring her fruitFit for the gods to feed on; youth and pleasureStill as she tasted should be doubled on her;And, if she be not heavenly, I would make herSo near the gods in nature, they should fear her.And then I am sure she would love me.—How now,keeper,Where’s Arcite?
Banished. Prince PirithousObtained his liberty, but never moreUpon his oath and life must he set footUpon this kingdom.
He’s a blessèd man.He shall see Thebes again, and call to armsThe bold young men that, when he bids ’em charge,Fall on like fire. Arcite shall have a fortune,If he dare make himself a worthy lover,Yet in the field to strike a battle for her,And, if he lose her then, he’s a cold coward.How bravely may he bear himself to win herIf he be noble Arcite—thousand ways!Were I at liberty, I would do thingsOf such a virtuous greatness that this lady,This blushing virgin, should take manhood to herAnd seek to ravish me.
My lord, for youI have this charge to—
To discharge my life?
No, but from this place to remove your Lordship;The windows are too open.
Devils take ’emThat are so envious to me! Prithee, kill me.
And hang for ’t afterward!
By this good light,Had I a sword I would kill thee.
Why, my lord?
Thou bringst such pelting, scurvy news continually,Thou art not worthy life. I will not go.
Indeed you must, my lord.
May I see the garden?
No.
Then I am resolved, I will not go.
I must constrain you then; and, for you aredangerous,I’ll clap more irons on you.
Do, good keeper.I’ll shake ’em so, you shall not sleep;I’ll make you a new morris. Must I go?
There is no remedy.
Farewell, kind window.May rude wind never hurt thee. O, my lady,If ever thou hast felt what sorrow was,Dream how I suffer.—Come; now bury me.
Banished the kingdom? ’Tis a benefit,A mercy I must thank ’em for; but banishedThe free enjoying of that face I die for,O, ’twas a studied punishment, a deathBeyond imagination—such a vengeanceThat, were I old and wicked, all my sinsCould never pluck upon me. Palamon,Thou hast the start now; thou shalt stay and seeHer bright eyes break each morning ’gainst thywindowAnd let in life into thee; thou shalt feedUpon the sweetness of a noble beautyThat nature ne’er exceeded nor ne’er shall.Good gods, what happiness has Palamon!Twenty to one he’ll come to speak to her,And if she be as gentle as she’s fair,I know she’s his. He has a tongue will tameTempests and make the wild rocks wanton.Come what can come,The worst is death. I will not leave the kingdom.I know mine own is but a heap of ruins,And no redress there. If I go, he has her.I am resolved another shape shall make meOr end my fortunes. Either way I am happy.I’ll see her and be near her, or no more.
My masters, I’ll be there, that’scertain.
And I’ll be there.
And I.
Why, then, have with you, boys.’Tis but a chiding. Let the plough play today; I’lltickle ’t out of the jades’ tails tomorrow.
I am sure to have my wife as jealousas a turkey, but that’s all one. I’ll go through;let her mumble.
Clap her aboard tomorrow nightand stow her, and all’s made up again.
Ay, do but put a fescue in her fistand you shall see her take a new lesson out and bea good wench. Do we all hold against the Maying?
Hold? What should ail us?
Arcas will be there.
And Sennois and Rycas; andthree better lads ne’er danced under green tree.And you know what wenches, ha! But will thedainty domine, the Schoolmaster, keep touch, doyou think? For he does all, you know.
He’ll eat a hornbook ere he fail.Go to, the matter’s too far driven between him andthe tanner’s daughter to let slip now; and she mustsee the Duke, and she must dance too.
Shall we be lusty?
All the boys in Athens blow windi’ th’ breech on ’s. And here I’ll be and there I’ll be,for our town, and here again, and there again. Ha,boys, hey for the weavers!
This must be done i’ th’ woods.
O pardon me.
By any means; our thing of learningsays so—where he himself will edify the Dukemost parlously in our behalfs. He’s excellent i’ th’woods; bring him to th’ plains, his learning makesno cry.
We’ll see the sports, then everyman to ’s tackle. And, sweet companions, let’s rehearse,by any means, before the ladies see us, anddo sweetly, and God knows what may come on ’t.
Content. The sports once ended,we’ll perform. Away, boys, and hold.
By your leaves, honest friends: pray you,whither go you?
Whither?Why, what a question’s that?
Yes, ’tis a questionTo me that know not.
To the games, my friend.
Where were you bred, you know it not?
Not far, sir.Are there such games today?
Yes, marry, are there,And such as you never saw. The Duke himselfWill be in person there.
What pastimes are they?
Wrestling and running.—’Tis a pretty fellow.
Thou wilt not go along?
Not yet, sir.
Well, sir,Take your own time.—Come, boys.
My mind misgivesme. This fellow has a vengeance trick o’ th’hip. Mark how his body’s made for ’t.
I’ll behanged, though, if he dare venture. Hang him,plum porridge! He wrestle? He roast eggs! Come,let’s be gone, lads.
This is an offered opportunityI durst not wish for. Well I could have wrestled—The best men called it excellent—and runSwifter than wind upon a field of corn,Curling the wealthy ears, never flew. I’ll venture,And in some poor disguise be there. Who knowsWhether my brows may not be girt with garlands,And happiness prefer me to a placeWhere I may ever dwell in sight of her?
Why should I love this gentleman? ’Tis oddsHe never will affect me. I am base,My father the mean keeper of his prison,And he a prince. To marry him is hopeless;To be his whore is witless. Out upon ’t!What pushes are we wenches driven toWhen fifteen once has found us! First, I saw him;I, seeing, thought he was a goodly man;He has as much to please a woman in him,If he please to bestow it so, as everThese eyes yet looked on. Next, I pitied him,And so would any young wench, o’ my conscience,That ever dreamed, or vowed her maidenheadTo a young handsome man. Then I loved him,Extremely loved him, infinitely loved him!And yet he had a cousin, fair as he too.But in my heart was Palamon, and there,Lord, what a coil he keeps! To hear himSing in an evening, what a heaven it is!And yet his songs are sad ones. Fairer spokenWas never gentleman. When I come inTo bring him water in a morning, firstHe bows his noble body, then salutes me thus:Fair, gentle maid, good morrow. May thy goodnessGet thee a happy husband. Once he kissed me;I loved my lips the better ten days after.Would he would do so ev’ry day! He grieves much—And me as much to see his misery.What should I do to make him know I love him?For I would fain enjoy him. Say I venturedTo set him free? What says the law then?Thus much for law or kindred! I will do it,And this night, or tomorrow, he shall love me.
You have done worthily. I have not seen,Since Hercules, a man of tougher sinews.Whate’er you are, you run the best and wrestleThat these times can allow.
I am proud to please you.
What country bred you?
This; but far off, prince.
Are you a gentleman?
My father said so,And to those gentle uses gave me life.
Are you his heir?
His youngest, sir.
Your father,Sure, is a happy sire, then. What proves you?
A little of all noble qualities.I could have kept a hawk and well have hallowedTo a deep cry of dogs. I dare not praiseMy feat in horsemanship, yet they that knew meWould say it was my best piece. Last, and greatest,I would be thought a soldier.
You are perfect.
Upon my soul, a proper man.
He is so.
How do you like him, lady?
I admire him.I have not seen so young a man so noble,If he say true, of his sort.
Believe,His mother was a wondrous handsome woman;His face, methinks, goes that way.
But his bodyAnd fiery mind illustrate a brave father.
Mark how his virtue, like a hidden sun,Breaks through his baser garments.
He’s well got, sure.
What made you seek this place, sir?
Noble Theseus,To purchase name and do my ablest serviceTo such a well-found wonder as thy worth;For only in thy court, of all the world,Dwells fair-eyed Honor.
All his words are worthy.
Sir, we are much indebted to your travel,Nor shall you lose your wish.—Pirithous,Dispose of this fair gentleman.
Thanks, Theseus.—Whate’er you are, you’re mine, and I shall give youTo a most noble service: to this lady,This bright young virgin.Pray observe her goodness;You have honored her fair birthday with yourvirtues,And, as your due, you’re hers. Kiss her fair hand, sir.
Sir, you’re a noble giver.—Dearest beauty,Thus let me seal my vowed faith.When your servant,Your most unworthy creature, but offends you,Command him die, he shall.
That were too cruel.If you deserve well, sir, I shall soon see ’t.You’re mine, and somewhat better than your rankI’ll use you.
I’ll see you furnished, and because you sayYou are a horseman, I must needs entreat youThis afternoon to ride—but ’tis a rough one.
I like him better, prince; I shall not thenFreeze in my saddle.
Sweet, you must be ready,—And you, Emilia,—and you, friend,—and all,Tomorrow by the sun, to do observanceTo flowery May in Dian’s wood.—Wait well, sir,Upon your mistress.—Emily, I hopeHe shall not go afoot.
That were a shame, sir,While I have horses.—Take your choice, and whatYou want at any time, let me but know it.If you serve faithfully, I dare assure youYou’ll find a loving mistress.
If I do not,Let me find that my father ever hated,Disgrace and blows.
Go lead the way; you have won it.It shall be so; you shall receive all duesFit for the honor you have won. ’Twere wrong else.—Sister, beshrew my heart, you have a servantThat, if I were a woman, would be master;But you are wise.
I hope too wise for that, sir.
Let all the dukes and all the devils roar!He is at liberty. I have ventured for him,And out I have brought him; to a little woodA mile hence I have sent him, where a cedarHigher than all the rest spreads like a planeFast by a brook, and there he shall keep closeTill I provide him files and food, for yetHis iron bracelets are not off. O Love,What a stout-hearted child thou art! My fatherDurst better have endured cold iron than done it.I love him beyond love and beyond reasonOr wit or safety. I have made him know it;I care not, I am desperate. If the lawFind me and then condemn me for ’t, some wenches,Some honest-hearted maids, will sing my dirgeAnd tell to memory my death was noble,Dying almost a martyr. That way he takesI purpose is my way too. Sure he cannotBe so unmanly as to leave me here.If he do, maids will not so easilyTrust men again. And yet he has not thanked meFor what I have done; no, not so much as kissed me,And that, methinks, is not so well; nor scarcelyCould I persuade him to become a free man,He made such scruples of the wrong he didTo me and to my father. Yet I hope,When he considers more, this love of mineWill take more root within him. Let him doWhat he will with me, so he use me kindly;For use me so he shall, or I’ll proclaim him,And to his face, no man. I’ll presentlyProvide him necessaries and pack my clothes up,And where there is a path of ground I’ll venture,So he be with me. By him like a shadowI’ll ever dwell. Within this hour the hubbubWill be all o’er the prison. I am thenKissing the man they look for. Farewell, father!Get many more such prisoners and such daughters,And shortly you may keep yourself. Now to him.
The Duke has lost Hippolyta; each tookA several laund. This is a solemn riteThey owe bloomed May, and the Athenians pay itTo th’ heart of ceremony. O Queen Emilia,Fresher than May, sweeterThan her gold buttons on the boughs, or allTh’ enameled knacks o’ th’ mead or garden—yea,We challenge too the bank of any nymphThat makes the stream seem flowers; thou, O jewelO’ th’ wood, o’ th’ world, hast likewise blessed a paceWith thy sole presence. In thy ruminationThat I, poor man, might eftsoons come betweenAnd chop on some cold thought! Thrice blessèdchanceTo drop on such a mistress, expectationMost guiltless on ’t. Tell me, O Lady Fortune,Next after Emily my sovereign, how farI may be proud. She takes strong note of me,Hath made me near her; and this beauteous morn,The prim’st of all the year, presents me withA brace of horses; two such steeds might wellBe by a pair of kings backed, in a fieldThat their crowns’ titles tried. Alas, alas,Poor cousin Palamon, poor prisoner, thouSo little dream’st upon my fortune thatThou think’st thyself the happier thing, to beSo near Emilia; me thou deem’st at Thebes,And therein wretched, although free. But ifThou knew’st my mistress breathed on me, and thatI eared her language, lived in her eye—O coz,What passion would enclose thee!
Traitor kinsman,Thou shouldst perceive my passion if these signsOf prisonment were off me, and this handBut owner of a sword. By all oaths in one,I and the justice of my love would make theeA confessed traitor, O thou most perfidiousThat ever gently looked, the void’st of honorThat e’er bore gentle token, falsest cousinThat ever blood made kin! Call’st thou her thine?I’ll prove it in my shackles, with these hands,Void of appointment, that thou liest, and artA very thief in love, a chaffy lord,Nor worth the name of villain. Had I a sword,And these house clogs away—
Dear cousin Palamon—
Cozener Arcite, give me language suchAs thou hast showed me feat.
Not finding inThe circuit of my breast any gross stuffTo form me like your blazon holds me toThis gentleness of answer: ’tis your passionThat thus mistakes, the which, to you being enemy,Cannot to me be kind. Honor and honestyI cherish and depend on, howsoe’erYou skip them in me, and with them, fair coz,I’ll maintain my proceedings. Pray be pleasedTo show in generous terms your griefs, since thatYour question’s with your equal, who professesTo clear his own way with the mind and swordOf a true gentleman.
That thou durst, Arcite!
My coz, my coz, you have been well advertisedHow much I dare; you’ve seen me use my swordAgainst th’ advice of fear. Sure, of anotherYou would not hear me doubted, but your silenceShould break out, though i’ th’ sanctuary.
Sir,I have seen you move in such a place which wellMight justify your manhood; you were calledA good knight and a bold. But the whole week’s notfairIf any day it rain; their valiant temperMen lose when they incline to treachery,And then they fight like compelled bears—would flyWere they not tied.
Kinsman, you might as wellSpeak this and act it in your glass as toHis ear which now disdains you.
Come up to me;Quit me of these cold gyves, give me a swordThough it be rusty, and the charityOf one meal lend me. Come before me then,A good sword in thy hand, and do but sayThat Emily is thine, I will forgiveThe trespass thou hast done me—yea, my life,If then thou carry ’t; and brave souls in shadesThat have died manly, which will seek of meSome news from Earth, they shall get none but this:That thou art brave and noble.
Be content.Again betake you to your hawthorn house.With counsel of the night I will be hereWith wholesome viands. These impedimentsWill I file off. You shall have garments andPerfumes to kill the smell o’ th’ prison. After,When you shall stretch yourself and say but Arcite,I am in plight, there shall be at your choiceBoth sword and armor.
O you heavens, dares anySo noble bear a guilty business? NoneBut only Arcite. Therefore none but ArciteIn this kind is so bold.
Sweet Palamon.
I do embrace you and your offer; forYour offer do ’t I only. Sir, your personWithout hypocrisy I may not wishMore than my sword’s edge on ’t.
You hear the horns.Enter your muset, lest this match between ’sBe crossed ere met. Give me your hand; farewell.I’ll bring you every needful thing. I pray you,Take comfort and be strong.
Pray hold your promise,And do the deed with a bent brow. Most certainYou love me not; be rough with me, and pourThis oil out of your language. By this air,I could for each word give a cuff, my stomachNot reconciled by reason.
Plainly spoken,Yet pardon me hard language. When I spurMy horse, I chide him not; content and angerIn me have but one face.Hark, sir, they callThe scattered to the banquet; you must guessI have an office there.
Sir, your attendanceCannot please heaven, and I know your officeUnjustly is achieved.
’Tis a good title.I am persuaded this question, sick between ’s,By bleeding must be cured. I am a suitorThat to your sword you will bequeath this plea,And talk of it no more.
But this one word:You are going now to gaze upon my mistress,For note you, mine she is—
Nay then,—
Nay, pray you,You talk of feeding me to breed me strength.You are going now to look upon a sunThat strengthens what it looks on; thereYou have a vantage o’er me, but enjoy ’t tillI may enforce my remedy. Farewell.
He has mistook the brake I meant, is goneAfter his fancy. ’Tis now well-nigh morning.No matter; would it were perpetual night,And darkness lord o’ th’ world. Hark, ’tis a wolf!In me hath grief slain fear, and but for one thing,I care for nothing, and that’s Palamon.I reck not if the wolves would jaw me, soHe had this file. What if I hallowed for him?I cannot hallow. If I whooped, what then?If he not answered, I should call a wolf,And do him but that service. I have heardStrange howls this livelong night; why may ’t not beThey have made prey of him? He has no weapons;He cannot run; the jingling of his gyvesMight call fell things to listen, who have in themA sense to know a man unarmed and canSmell where resistance is. I’ll set it downHe’s torn to pieces; they howled many together,And then they fed on him; so much for that.Be bold to ring the bell. How stand I then?All’s chared when he is gone. No, no, I lie.My father’s to be hanged for his escape;Myself to beg, if I prized life so muchAs to deny my act, but that I would not,Should I try death by dozens. I am moped;Food took I none these two days;Sipped some water. I have not closed mine eyesSave when my lids scoured off their brine. Alas,Dissolve, my life! Let not my sense unsettle,Lest I should drown, or stab, or hang myself.O state of nature, fail together in me,Since thy best props are warped! So, which way now?The best way is the next way to a grave;Each errant step beside is torment. Lo,The moon is down, the crickets chirp, the screechowlCalls in the dawn. All offices are doneSave what I fail in. But the point is this—An end, and that is all.
I should be near the place.—Ho! Cousin Palamon!
Arcite?
The same. I have brought you food and files.Come forth and fear not; here’s no Theseus.
Nor none so honest, Arcite.
That’s no matter.We’ll argue that hereafter. Come, take courage;You shall not die thus beastly. Here, sir, drink—I know you are faint—then I’ll talk further with you.
Arcite, thou mightst now poison me.
I might;But I must fear you first. Sit down and, good now,No more of these vain parleys. Let us not,Having our ancient reputation with us,Make talk for fools and cowards. To your health.
Do!
Pray sit down, then, and let me entreat you,By all the honesty and honor in you,No mention of this woman; ’twill disturb us.We shall have time enough.
Well, sir, I’ll pledge you.
Drink a good hearty draught; it breeds good blood,man.Do not you feel it thaw you?
Stay, I’ll tell youAfter a draught or two more.
Spare it not.The Duke has more, coz. Eat now.
Yes.
I am gladYou have so good a stomach.
I am gladderI have so good meat to ’t.
Is ’t not mad lodgingHere in the wild woods, cousin?
Yes, for themThat have wild consciences.
How tastes yourvictuals?Your hunger needs no sauce, I see.
Not much.But if it did, yours is too tart, sweet cousin.What is this?
Venison.
’Tis a lusty meat.Give me more wine. Here, Arcite, to the wenchesWe have known in our days!The Lord Steward’sdaughter!Do you remember her?
After you, coz.
She loved a black-haired man.
She did so; well, sir?
And I have heard some call him Arcite, and—
Out with ’t, faith.
She met him in an arbor.What did she there, coz? Play o’ th’ virginals?
Something she did, sir.
Made her groan a monthfor ’t—Or two, or three, or ten.
The Marshal’s sisterHad her share, too, as I remember, cousin,Else there be tales abroad. You’ll pledge her?
Yes.
A pretty brown wench ’tis. There was a timeWhen young men went a-hunting, and a wood,And a broad beech—and thereby hangs a tale.Heigh ho!
For Emily, upon my life! Fool,Away with this strained mirth. I say againThat sigh was breathed for Emily. Base cousin,Dar’st thou break first?
You are wide.
By heaven andEarth,There’s nothing in thee honest.
Then I’ll leave you.You are a beast now.
As thou mak’st me, traitor.
There’s all things needful: files and shirts andperfumes.I’ll come again some two hours hence and bringThat that shall quiet all.
A sword and armor.
Fear me not. You are now too foul. Farewell.Get off your trinkets; you shall want naught.
Sirrah—
I’ll hear no more.
If he keep touch, he dies for ’t.
I am very cold, and all the stars are out too,The little stars and all, that look like aglets.The sun has seen my folly.—Palamon!Alas, no; he’s in heaven. Where am I now?Yonder’s the sea, and there’s a ship. How ’t tumbles!And there’s a rock lies watching under water.Now, now, it beats upon it; now, now, now,There’s a leak sprung, a sound one! How they cry!Open her before the wind; you’ll lose all else.Up with a course or two, and tack about, boys!Good night, good night; you’re gone. I am veryhungry.Would I could find a fine frog; he would tell meNews from all parts o’ th’ world; then would I makeA carrack of a cockleshell, and sailBy east and northeast to the king of pygmies,For he tells fortunes rarely. Now my father,Twenty to one, is trussed up in a triceTomorrow morning. I’ll say never a word.For I’ll cut my green coat a foot above my knee,And I’ll clip my yellow locks an inch below mineeye.Hey nonny, nonny, nonny.He’s buy me a white cut, forth for to ride,And I’ll go seek him through the world that is sowide.Hey nonny, nonny, nonny.O, for a prick now, like a nightingale,To put my breast against. I shall sleep like a top else.
Fie, fie, what tediosity and disinsanityis here among you! Have my rudiments been laboredso long with you, milked unto you, and, by afigure, even the very plum broth and marrow ofmy understanding laid upon you, and do you stillcry Where? and How? and Wherefore? Youmost coarse-frieze capacities, you jean judgments,have I said Thus let be and There let beand Then let be and no man understand me? Prohdeum, medius fidius, you are all dunces! Forwhy,here stand I; here the Duke comes; there are you,close in the thicket; the Duke appears; I meet himand unto him I utter learnèd things and many figures;he hears, and nods, and hums, and then criesRare! and I go forward. At length I fling my capup—mark there! Then do you as once did Meleagerand the boar—break comely out before him;like true lovers, cast yourselves in a body decently,and sweetly, by a figure, trace and turn, boys.
And sweetly we will do it, MasterGerald.
Draw up the company. Where’sthe taborer?
Why, Timothy!
Here, my mad boys. Have at you!
But I say, where’s their women?
Here’s Fritz and Maudlin.
And little Luce with the whitelegs, and bouncing Barbary.
And freckled Nell, that never failedher master.
Where be your ribbons, maids? Swimwith your bodies, and carry it sweetly and deliverly,and now and then a favor and a frisk.
Let us alone, sir.
Where’s the rest o’ th’ music?
Dispersed, as you commanded.
Couple, then, and see what’s wanting.Where’s the Bavian?—My friend, carry your tailwithout offense or scandal to the ladies; and besure you tumble with audacity and manhood, andwhen you bark, do it with judgment.
Yes, sir.
Quo usque tandem? Here is a womanwanting.
We may go whistle; all the fat’s i’th’ fire.
We have, as learnèd authors utter,washed a tile; we have been fatuus and laboredvainly.
This is that scornful piece, thatscurvy hilding that gave her promise faithfully shewould be here—Cicely, the sempster’s daughter.The next gloves that I give her shall be dogskin;nay, an she fail me once—you can tell, Arcas, sheswore by wine and bread she would not break.
An eel and woman, a learnèd poetsays, unless by th’ tail and with thy teeth thou hold,will either fail. In manners, this was falseposition.
A fire ill take her! Does she flinchnow?
What shall we determine, sir?
Nothing. Our business is become anullity, yea, and a woeful and a piteous nullity.
Now, when the credit of our townlay on it, now to be frampold, now to piss o’ th’nettle! Go thy ways; I’ll remember thee. I’ll fitthee!
The George Alow came from the south,From the coast of Barbary-a,And there he met with brave gallants of war,By one, by two, by three-a.Well hailed, well hailed, you jolly gallants,And whither now are you bound-a?O, let me have your companyTill I come to the sound-a.There was three fools, fell out about an owlet—The one he said it was an owl,The other he said nay,The third he said it was a hawk,And her bells were cut away.
There’s a dainty madwoman, master,comes i’ th’ nick, as mad as a March hare. If wecan get her dance, we are made again. I warranther, she’ll do the rarest gambols.
A madwoman? We are made, boys.
And are you mad,good woman?
I would be sorry else. Give me your hand.
Why?
I can tell your fortune.You are a fool. Tell ten.—I have posed him.Buzz!—Friend, you must eat no white bread; ifyou do, your teeth will bleed extremely. Shall wedance, ho? I know you, you’re a tinker. Sirrah tinker,stop no more holes but what you should.
Dii boni! A tinker, damsel?
Or a conjurer. Raise me a devil now, and lethim play Chi passa o’ th’ bells and bones.
Go, take her, and fluently persuade herto a peace. Et opus exegi, quod nec Iovis ira, necignis. Strike up, and lead her in.
Come, lass, let’s trip it.
I’ll lead.
Do, do!
Persuasively, and cunningly.Away, boys! I hear the horns. Give me somemeditation, and mark your cue.Pallas, inspire me!
This way the stag took.
Stay, and edify!
What have we here?
Some country sport, upon my life, sir.
Well, sir, go forward. Wewill edify.Ladies, sit down. We’ll stay it.
Thou doughty duke, all hail!—All hail, sweet ladies!
This is a cold beginning.
If you but favor, our country pastime made is.We are a few of those collected hereThat ruder tongues distinguish villager.And to say verity, and not to fable,We are a merry rout, or else a rabble,Or company, or by a figure, chorus,That ’fore thy dignity will dance a morris.And I that am the rectifier of all,By title pedagogus, that let fallThe birch upon the breeches of the small ones,And humble with a ferula the tall ones,Do here present this machine, or this frame.And, dainty duke, whose doughty dismal fameFrom Dis to Daedalus, from post to pillar,Is blown abroad, help me, thy poor well-willer,And with thy twinkling eyes look right and straightUpon this mighty Morr, of mickle weight—Is now comes in, which being glued togetherMakes Morris, and the cause that we came hither.The body of our sport, of no small study,I first appear, though rude, and raw, and muddy,To speak before thy noble grace this tenner,At whose great feet I offer up my penner.The next, the Lord of May and Lady bright,The Chambermaid and Servingman by nightThat seek out silent hanging; then mine HostAnd his fat Spouse, that welcomes to their costThe gallèd traveler, and with a beck’ningInforms the tapster to inflame the reck’ning;Then the beest-eating Clown; and next the Fool,The Bavian with long tail and eke long tool,Cum multis aliis that make a dance;Say ay, and all shall presently advance.
Ay, ay, by any means, dear Domine.
Produce!
Intrate, filii. Come forth and foot it.
Ladies, if we have been merryAnd have pleased ye with a derry,And a derry and a down,Say the Schoolmaster’s no clown.—Duke, if we have pleased thee tooAnd have done as good boys should do,Give us but a tree or twainFor a Maypole, and again,Ere another year run out,We’ll make thee laugh, and all this rout.
Take twenty, Domine.—How does my sweetheart?
Never so pleased, sir.
’Twas an excellent dance,And, for a preface, I never heard a better.
Schoolmaster, I thank you.—One see ’em allrewarded.
And here’s something to paint your pole withal.
Now to our sports again.
May the stag thou hunt’st stand long,And thy dogs be swift and strong;May they kill him without lets,And the ladies eat his dowsets.Come, we are all made. Dii deaeque omnes,You have danced rarely, wenches.
About this hour my cousin gave his faithTo visit me again, and with him bringTwo swords and two good armors. If he fail,He’s neither man nor soldier. When he left me,I did not think a week could have restoredMy lost strength to me, I was grown so lowAnd crestfall’n with my wants. I thank thee, Arcite,Thou art yet a fair foe, and I feel myself,With this refreshing, able once againTo outdure danger. To delay it longerWould make the world think, when it comes tohearing,That I lay fatting like a swine to fightAnd not a soldier. Therefore, this blest morningShall be the last; and that sword he refuses,If it but hold, I kill him with. ’Tis justice.So, love and fortune for me!O, good morrow.
Good morrow, noble kinsman.
I have put youTo too much pains, sir.
That too much, fair cousin,Is but a debt to honor and my duty.
Would you were so in all, sir; I could wish youAs kind a kinsman as you force me findA beneficial foe, that my embracesMight thank you, not my blows.
I shall think either,Well done, a noble recompense.
Then I shall quit you.
Defy me in these fair terms, and you showMore than a mistress to me. No more anger,As you love anything that’s honorable!We were not bred to talk, man; when we are armedAnd both upon our guards, then let our fury,Like meeting of two tides, fly strongly from us,And then to whom the birthright of this beautyTruly pertains—without upbraidings, scorns,Despisings of our persons, and such poutings,Fitter for girls and schoolboys—will be seen,And quickly, yours or mine. Will ’t please you arm,sir?Or if you feel yourself not fitting yetAnd furnished with your old strength, I’ll stay,cousin,And ev’ry day discourse you into health,As I am spared. Your person I am friends with,And I could wish I had not said I loved her,Though I had died. But loving such a lady,And justifying my love, I must not fly from ’t.
Arcite, thou art so brave an enemyThat no man but thy cousin’s fit to kill thee.I am well and lusty. Choose your arms.
Choose you, sir.
Wilt thou exceed in all, or dost thou do itTo make me spare thee?
If you think so, cousin,You are deceived, for as I am a soldier,I will not spare you.
That’s well said.
You’ll find it.
Then, as I am an honest man and loveWith all the justice of affection,I’ll pay thee soundly.This I’ll take.
That’s mine, then.I’ll arm you first.
Do.Pray thee tell me, cousin,Where got’st thou this good armor?
’Tis the Duke’s,And to say true, I stole it. Do I pinch you?
No.
Is ’t not too heavy?
I have worn a lighter,But I shall make it serve.
I’ll buckle ’t close.
By any means.
You care not for a grand guard?
No, no, we’ll use no horses. I perceiveYou would fain be at that fight.
I am indifferent.
Faith, so am I. Good cousin, thrust the buckleThrough far enough.
I warrant you.
My casque now.
Will you fight bare-armed?
We shall be the nimbler.
But use your gauntlets though. Those are o’ th’ least.Prithee take mine, good cousin.
Thank you, Arcite.How do I look? Am I fall’n much away?
Faith, very little; love has used you kindly.
I’ll warrant thee, I’ll strike home.
Do, and spare not.I’ll give you cause, sweet cousin.
Now to you, sir.Methinks this armor’s very like that, Arcite,Thou wor’st that day the three kings fell, but lighter.
That was a very good one, and that day,I well remember, you outdid me, cousin.I never saw such valor. When you chargedUpon the left wing of the enemy,I spurred hard to come up, and under meI had a right good horse.
You had, indeed;A bright bay, I remember.
Yes, but allWas vainly labored in me; you outwent me,Nor could my wishes reach you; yet a littleI did by imitation.
More by virtue;You are modest, cousin.
When I saw you charge first,Methought I heard a dreadful clap of thunderBreak from the troop.
But still before that flewThe lightning of your valor. Stay a little;Is not this piece too strait?
No, no, ’tis well.
I would have nothing hurt thee but my sword.A bruise would be dishonor.
Now I am perfect.
Stand off, then.
Take my sword; I hold it better.
I thank you, no; keep it; your life lies on it.Here’s one; if it but hold, I ask no moreFor all my hopes. My cause and honor guard me!
And me my love!Is there aught else to say?
This only, and no more: thou art mine aunt’s son.And that blood we desire to shed is mutual—In me thine, and in thee mine. My swordIs in my hand, and if thou kill’st me,The gods and I forgive thee. If there beA place prepared for those that sleep in honor,I wish his weary soul that falls may win it.Fight bravely, cousin. Give me thy noble hand.
Here, Palamon. This hand shall never moreCome near thee with such friendship.
I commend thee.
If I fall, curse me, and say I was a coward,For none but such dare die in these just trials.Once more farewell, my cousin.
Farewell, Arcite.
Lo, cousin, lo, our folly has undone us!
Why?
This is the Duke, a-hunting, as I told you.If we be found, we are wretched. O, retire,For honor’s sake, and safely, presentlyInto your bush again. Sir, we shall findToo many hours to die in. Gentle cousin,If you be seen, you perish instantlyFor breaking prison, and I, if you reveal me,For my contempt. Then all the world will scorn us,And say we had a noble difference,But base disposers of it.
No, no, cousin,I will no more be hidden, nor put offThis great adventure to a second trial.I know your cunning, and I know your cause.He that faints now, shame take him! Put thyselfUpon thy present guard—
You are not mad?
Or I will make th’ advantage of this hourMine own, and what to come shall threaten meI fear less than my fortune. Know, weak cousin,I love Emilia, and in that I’ll buryThee and all crosses else.
Then come what can come,Thou shalt know, Palamon, I dare as wellDie as discourse or sleep. Only this fears me:The law will have the honor of our ends.Have at thy life!
Look to thine own well, Arcite.
What ignorant and mad malicious traitorsAre you, that ’gainst the tenor of my lawsAre making battle, thus like knights appointed,Without my leave and officers of arms?By Castor, both shall die.
Hold thy word, Theseus.We are certainly both traitors, both despisersOf thee and of thy goodness. I am Palamon,That cannot love thee, he that broke thy prison.Think well what that deserves. And this is Arcite.A bolder traitor never trod thy ground,A falser ne’er seemed friend. This is the manWas begged and banished; this is he contemns theeAnd what thou dar’st do; and in this disguise,Against thine own edict, follows thy sister,That fortunate bright star, the fair Emilia,Whose servant—if there be a right in seeingAnd first bequeathing of the soul to—justlyI am; and, which is more, dares think her his.This treachery, like a most trusty lover,I called him now to answer. If thou be’stAs thou art spoken, great and virtuous,The true decider of all injuries,Say Fight again, and thou shalt see me, Theseus,Do such a justice thou thyself wilt envy.Then take my life; I’ll woo thee to ’t.
O heaven,What more than man is this!
I have sworn.
We seek notThy breath of mercy, Theseus. ’Tis to meA thing as soon to die as thee to say it,And no more moved. Where this man calls metraitor,Let me say thus much: if in love be treason,In service of so excellent a beauty,As I love most, and in that faith will perish,As I have brought my life here to confirm it,As I have served her truest, worthiest,As I dare kill this cousin that denies it,So let me be most traitor, and you please me.For scorning thy edict, duke, ask that ladyWhy she is fair, and why her eyes command meStay here to love her; and if she say traitor,I am a villain fit to lie unburied.
Thou shalt have pity of us both, O Theseus,If unto neither thou show mercy. Stop,As thou art just, thy noble ear against us;As thou art valiant, for thy cousin’s soul,Whose twelve strong labors crown his memory,Let’s die together at one instant, duke;Only a little let him fall before me,That I may tell my soul he shall not have her.
I grant your wish, for to say true, your cousinHas ten times more offended, for I gave himMore mercy than you found, sir, your offensesBeing no more than his.—None here speak for ’em,For ere the sun set both shall sleep forever.
Alas, the pity! Now or never, sister,Speak not to be denied. That face of yoursWill bear the curses else of after agesFor these lost cousins.
In my face, dear sister,I find no anger to ’em, nor no ruin.The misadventure of their own eyes kill ’em.Yet that I will be woman and have pity,My knees shall grow to th’ ground but I’ll get mercy.Help me, dear sister; in a deed so virtuous,The powers of all women will be with us.Most royal brother—
Sir, by our tie of marriage—
By your own spotless honor—
By that faith,That fair hand, and that honest heart you gave me—
By that you would have pity in another;By your own virtues infinite—
By valor;By all the chaste nights I have ever pleased you—
These are strange conjurings.
Nay, then, I’ll in too.By all our friendship, sir, by all our dangers;By all you love most, wars and this sweet lady—
By that you would have trembled to denyA blushing maid—
By your own eyes; by strength,In which you swore I went beyond all women,Almost all men, and yet I yielded, Theseus—
To crown all this: by your most noble soul,Which cannot want due mercy, I beg first—
Next hear my prayers—
Last let me entreat, sir—
For mercy.
Mercy.
Mercy on these princes.
You make my faith reel. Say I feltCompassion to ’em both, how would you place it?
Upon their lives, but with their banishments.
You are a right woman, sister: you have pity,But want the understanding where to use it.If you desire their lives, invent a waySafer than banishment. Can these two live,And have the agony of love about ’em,And not kill one another? Every dayThey’d fight about you, hourly bring your honorIn public question with their swords. Be wise, then,And here forget ’em; it concerns your creditAnd my oath equally. I have said they die.Better they fall by th’ law than one another.Bow not my honor.
O, my noble brother,That oath was rashly made, and in your anger;Your reason will not hold it. If such vowsStand for express will, all the world must perish.Besides, I have another oath ’gainst yours,Of more authority, I am sure more love,Not made in passion neither, but good heed.
What is it, sister?
Urge it home, brave lady.
That you would ne’er deny me anythingFit for my modest suit and your free granting.I tie you to your word now; if you fail in ’t,Think how you maim your honor—For now I am set a-begging, sir, I am deafTo all but your compassion—how their livesMight breed the ruin of my name. Opinion!Shall anything that loves me perish for me?That were a cruel wisdom. Do men pruneThe straight young boughs that blush with thousandblossomsBecause they may be rotten? O, Duke Theseus,The goodly mothers that have groaned for these,And all the longing maids that ever loved,If your vow stand, shall curse me and my beauty,And in their funeral songs for these two cousinsDespise my cruelty, and cry woe worth me,Till I am nothing but the scorn of women.For heaven’s sake, save their lives, and banish ’em.
On what conditions?
Swear ’em never moreTo make me their contention, or to know me,To tread upon thy dukedom, and to be,Wherever they shall travel, ever strangersTo one another.
I’ll be cut a-piecesBefore I take this oath! Forget I love her?O, all you gods, despise me then! Thy banishmentI not mislike, so we may fairly carryOur swords and cause along; else never trifle,But take our lives, duke. I must love, and will,And for that love must and dare kill this cousinOn any piece the Earth has.
Will you, Arcite,Take these conditions?
He’s a villain, then.
These are men!
No, never, duke. ’Tis worse to me than beggingTo take my life so basely; though I thinkI never shall enjoy her, yet I’ll preserveThe honor of affection, and die for her,Make death a devil!
What may be done? For now I feel compassion.
Let it not fall again, sir.
Say, Emilia,If one of them were dead, as one must, are youContent to take th’ other to your husband?They cannot both enjoy you. They are princesAs goodly as your own eyes, and as nobleAs ever fame yet spoke of. Look upon ’em,And, if you can love, end this difference.I give consent.—Are you content too, princes?
With all our souls.
He that she refusesMust die then.
Any death thou canst invent, duke.
If I fall from that mouth, I fall with favor,And lovers yet unborn shall bless my ashes.
If she refuse me, yet my grave will wed me,And soldiers sing my epitaph.
Make choice, then.
I cannot, sir; they are both too excellent.For me, a hair shall never fall of these men.
What will become of ’em?
Thus I ordain it—And, by mine honor, once again, it stands,Or both shall die: you shall both to your country,And each within this month, accompaniedWith three fair knights, appear again in this place,In which I’ll plant a pyramid; and whether,Before us that are here, can force his cousinBy fair and knightly strength to touch the pillar,He shall enjoy her; the other lose his head,And all his friends; nor shall he grudge to fall,Nor think he dies with interest in this lady.Will this content you?
Yes.—Here, Cousin Arcite,I am friends again till that hour.
I embrace you.
Are you content, sister?
Yes, I must, sir,Else both miscarry.
Come, shake hands again, then,And take heed, as you are gentlemen, this quarrelSleep till the hour prefixed, and hold your course.
We dare not fail thee, Theseus.
Come, I’ll give youNow usage like to princes and to friends.When you return, who wins I’ll settle here;Who loses, yet I’ll weep upon his bier.
Heard you no more? Was nothing said of meConcerning the escape of Palamon?Good sir, remember!
Nothing that I heard,For I came home before the businessWas fully ended. Yet I might perceive,Ere I departed, a great likelihoodOf both their pardons; for HippolytaAnd fair-eyed Emily, upon their knees,Begged with such handsome pity that the Duke,Methought, stood staggering whether he shouldfollowHis rash oath or the sweet compassionOf those two ladies. And, to second them,That truly noble prince, Pirithous—Half his own heart—set in too, that I hopeAll shall be well. Neither heard I one questionOf your name or his ’scape.
Pray heaven it hold so.
Be of good comfort, man; I bring you news,Good news.
They are welcome.
Palamon has clearedyouAnd got your pardon, and discovered howAnd by whose means he escaped, which was yourdaughter’s,Whose pardon is procured too; and the prisoner,Not to be held ungrateful to her goodness,Has given a sum of money to her marriage—A large one, I’ll assure you.
You are a good manAnd ever bring good news.
How was it ended?
Why, as it should be: they that ne’er beggedBut they prevailed had their suits fairly granted;The prisoners have their lives.
I knew ’twould be so.
But there be new conditions, which you’ll hear ofAt better time.
I hope they are good.
They arehonorable;How good they’ll prove I know not.
’Twill be known.
Alas, sir, where’s your daughter?
Why do you ask?
O, sir, when did you see her?
How he looks!
This morning.
Was she well? Was she in health?Sir, when did she sleep?
These are strange questions.
I do not think she was very well—for nowYou make me mind her; but this very dayI asked her questions, and she answered meSo far from what she was, so childishly,So sillily, as if she were a fool,An innocent, and I was very angry.But what of her, sir?
Nothing but my pity;But you must know it, and as good by meAs by another that less loves her.
Well, sir?
No, sir, not well.
Not right?
Not well?
’Tis too true; she is mad.
It cannot be.
Believe you’ll find it so.
I half suspectedWhat you told me. The gods comfort her!Either this was her love to Palamon,Or fear of my miscarrying on his ’scape,Or both.
’Tis likely.
But why all this haste, sir?
I’ll tell you quickly. As I late was anglingIn the great lake that lies behind the palace,From the far shore—thick set with reeds andsedges—As patiently I was attending sport,I heard a voice, a shrill one; and, attentive,I gave my ear, when I might well perceive’Twas one that sung, and by the smallness of itA boy or woman. I then left my angleTo his own skill, came near, but yet perceived notWho made the sound, the rushes and the reedsHad so encompassed it. I laid me downAnd listened to the words she sung, for then,Through a small glade cut by the fishermen,I saw it was your daughter.
Pray go on, sir.
She sung much, but no sense; only I heard herRepeat this often: Palamon is gone,Is gone to th’ wood to gather mulberries;I’ll find him out tomorrow.
Pretty soul!
His shackles will betray him; he’ll be taken,And what shall I do then? I’ll bring a bevy,A hundred black-eyed maids that love as I do,With chaplets on their heads of daffadillies,With cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses,And all we’ll dance an antic ’fore the Duke,And beg his pardon. Then she talked of you, sir—That you must lose your head tomorrow morning,And she must gather flowers to bury you,And see the house made handsome. Then she sungNothing but Willow, willow, willow, and betweenEver was Palamon, fair Palamon,And Palamon was a tall young man. The placeWas knee-deep where she sat; her careless tresses,A wreath of bulrush rounded; about her stuckThousand freshwater flowers of several colors,That methought she appeared like the fair nymphThat feeds the lake with waters, or as IrisNewly dropped down from heaven. Rings she madeOf rushes that grew by, and to ’em spokeThe prettiest posies: Thus our true love’s tied,This you may lose, not me, and many a one;And then she wept, and sung again, and sighed,And with the same breath smiled and kissed herhand.
Alas, what pity it is!
I made in to her.She saw me, and straight sought the flood. I savedherAnd set her safe to land, when presentlyShe slipped away, and to the city madeWith such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,She left me far behind her. Three or fourI saw from far off cross her—one of ’emI knew to be your brother—where she stayedAnd fell, scarce to be got away. I left them with herAnd hither came to tell you.Here they are.
May you never more enjoy the light, etc.Is not this a fine song?
O, a very fine one.
I can sing twenty more.
I think you can.
Yes, truly can I. I can sing The Broomand Bonny Robin. Are not you a tailor?
Yes.
Where’s my wedding gown?
I’ll bring it tomorrow.
Do, very rarely, I must be abroad else tocall the maids and pay the minstrels, for I mustlose my maidenhead by cocklight. ’Twill neverthrive else.O fair, O sweet, etc.
You must e’en take it patiently.
’Tis true.
Good e’en, good men. Pray, did you everhear of one young Palamon?
Yes, wench, we know him.
Is ’t not a fine young gentleman?
’Tis, love.
By no mean cross her; sheis then distempered far worse than now sheshows.
Yes, he’s a fine man.
O, is he so? You have a sister.
Yes.
But she shall never have him—tell her so—for a trick that I know; you’d best look to her, forif she see him once, she’s gone, she’s done andundone in an hour. All the young maids of ourtown are in love with him, but I laugh at ’em andlet ’em all alone. Is ’t not a wise course?
Yes.
There is at least two hundred now withchild by him—there must be four; yet I keep closefor all this, close as a cockle; and all these must beboys—he has the trick on ’t—and at ten years oldthey must be all gelt for musicians and sing thewars of Theseus.
This is strange.
As ever you heard, but say nothing.
No.
They come from all parts of the dukedomto him; I’ll warrant you, he had not so few lastnight as twenty to dispatch. He’ll tickle ’t up in twohours, if his hand be in.
She’s lost past all cure.
Heaven forbid, man!
Come hither; you are a wiseman.
Does she know him?
No; would she did.
You are master of a ship?
Yes.
Where’s your compass?
Here.
Set it to th’ north. And now direct yourcourse to th’ wood, where Palamon lies longing forme. For the tackling, let me alone.—Come, weigh,my hearts, cheerly.
Owgh, owgh, owgh!—’Tis up!The wind’s fair!—Top the bowline!—Out with themain sail! Where’s your whistle, master?
Let’s get her in!
Up to the top, boy!
Where’s the pilot?
Here.
What kenn’st thou?
A fair wood.
Bear for it, master. Tack about!When Cynthia with her borrowed light, etc.
Yet I may bind those wounds up that must openAnd bleed to death for my sake else. I’ll choose,And end their strife. Two such young handsome menShall never fall for me; their weeping mothers,Following the dead cold ashes of their sons,Shall never curse my cruelty.Good heaven,What a sweet face has Arcite! If wise Nature,With all her best endowments, all those beautiesShe sows into the births of noble bodies,Were here a mortal woman, and had in herThe coy denials of young maids, yet doubtlessShe would run mad for this man. What an eye,Of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness,Has this young prince! Here Love himself sitssmiling;Just such another wanton GanymedeSet Jove afire with, and enforced the godSnatch up the goodly boy and set him by him,A shining constellation. What a brow,Of what a spacious majesty, he carries,Arched like the great-eyed Juno’s but far sweeter,Smoother than Pelops’ shoulder! Fame and Honor,Methinks, from hence as from a promontoryPointed in heaven, should clap their wings and singTo all the under world the loves and fightsOf gods and such men near ’em.PalamonIs but his foil, to him a mere dull shadow;He’s swart and meager, of an eye as heavyAs if he had lost his mother; a still temper,No stirring in him, no alacrity;Of all this sprightly sharpness not a smile.Yet these that we count errors may become him;Narcissus was a sad boy but a heavenly.O, who can find the bent of woman’s fancy?I am a fool; my reason is lost in me;I have no choice, and I have lied so lewdlyThat women ought to beat me. On my kneesI ask thy pardon: Palamon, thou art aloneAnd only beautiful, and these the eyes,These the bright lamps of beauty, that commandAnd threaten love, and what young maid dare cross’em?What a bold gravity, and yet inviting,Has this brown manly face! O Love, this onlyFrom this hour is complexion. Lie there, Arcite.Thou art a changeling to him, a mere gypsy,And this the noble body. I am sotted,Utterly lost. My virgin’s faith has fled me.For if my brother but even now had asked meWhether I loved, I had run mad for Arcite.Now, if my sister, more for Palamon.Stand both together. Now, come ask me, brother.Alas, I know not! Ask me now, sweet sister.I may go look! What a mere child is Fancy,That, having two fair gauds of equal sweetness,Cannot distinguish, but must cry for both.How now, sir?
From the noble duke, your brother,Madam, I bring you news: the knights are come.
To end the quarrel?
Yes.
Would I might end first!What sins have I committed, chaste Diana,That my unspotted youth must now be soiledWith blood of princes, and my chastityBe made the altar where the lives of lovers—Two greater and two better never yetMade mothers joy—must be the sacrificeTo my unhappy beauty?
Bring ’em inQuickly, by any means; I long to see ’em.Your two contending lovers arereturned,And with them their fair knights. Now, my fairsister,You must love one of them.
I had rather both,So neither for my sake should fall untimely.
Who saw ’em?
I awhile.
And I.
From whence come you, sir?
From the knights.
Prayspeak,You that have seen them, what they are.
I will, sir,And truly what I think. Six braver spiritsThan these they have brought, if we judge by theoutside,I never saw nor read of. He that standsIn the first place with Arcite, by his seeming,Should be a stout man, by his face a prince—His very looks so say him; his complexionNearer a brown than black—stern and yet noble—Which shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers;The circles of his eyes show fire within him,And as a heated lion, so he looks.His hair hangs long behind him, black and shiningLike ravens’ wings; his shoulders broad and strong,Armed long and round; and on his thigh a swordHung by a curious baldric, when he frownsTo seal his will with. Better, o’ my conscience,Was never soldier’s friend.
Thou hast well described him.
Yet a greatdeal short,Methinks, of him that’s first with Palamon.
Pray speak him, friend.
I guess he is a prince too,And, if it may be, greater; for his showHas all the ornament of honor in ’t:He’s somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of,But of a face far sweeter; his complexionIs, as a ripe grape, ruddy. He has feltWithout doubt what he fights for, and so apterTo make this cause his own. In ’s face appearsAll the fair hopes of what he undertakes,And when he’s angry, then a settled valor,Not tainted with extremes, runs through his bodyAnd guides his arm to brave things. Fear he cannot;He shows no such soft temper. His head’s yellow,Hard-haired and curled, thick-twined like ivy tods,Not to undo with thunder. In his faceThe livery of the warlike maid appears,Pure red and white, for yet no beard has blessed him.And in his rolling eyes sits Victory,As if she ever meant to crown his valor.His nose stands high, a character of honor;His red lips, after fights, are fit for ladies.
Must these men die too?
When he speaks, his tongueSounds like a trumpet. All his lineamentsAre as a man would wish ’em, strong and clean.He wears a well-steeled axe, the staff of gold;His age some five-and-twenty.
There’s another—A little man, but of a tough soul, seemingAs great as any; fairer promisesIn such a body yet I never looked on.
O, he that’s freckle-faced?
The same, my lord.Are they not sweet ones?
Yes, they are well.
Methinks,Being so few, and well disposed, they showGreat and fine art in nature. He’s white-haired—Not wanton white, but such a manly colorNext to an auburn; tough and nimble-set,Which shows an active soul. His arms are brawny,Lined with strong sinews—to the shoulder-pieceGently they swell, like women new-conceived,Which speaks him prone to labor, never faintingUnder the weight of arms; stout-hearted still,But when he stirs, a tiger. He’s grey-eyed,Which yields compassion where he conquers; sharpTo spy advantages, and where he finds ’em,He’s swift to make ’em his. He does no wrongs,Nor takes none. He’s round-faced, and when hesmilesHe shows a lover; when he frowns, a soldier.About his head he wears the winner’s oak,And in it stuck the favor of his lady.His age some six-and-thirty. In his handHe bears a charging-staff embossed with silver.
Are they all thus?
They are all the sons of honor.
Now, as I have a soul, I long to see ’em.—Lady, you shall see men fight now.
I wish it,But not the cause, my lord. They would showBravely about the titles of two kingdoms;’Tis pity love should be so tyrannous.—O, my soft-hearted sister, what think you?Weep not till they weep blood. Wench, it must be.
You have steeled ’em with your beauty.Honored friend,To you I give the field; pray order itFitting the persons that must use it.
Yes, sir.
Come, I’ll go visit ’em. I cannot stay—Their fame has fired me so—till they appear.Good friend, be royal.
There shall want no bravery.
Poor wench, go weep, for whosoever winsLoses a noble cousin for thy sins.
Her distraction is more at some time of themoon than at other some, is it not?
She is continually in a harmless distemper,sleeps little, altogether without appetite, save oftendrinking, dreaming of another world, and a better;and what broken piece of matter soe’er she’s about,the name Palamon lards it, that she farces ev’rybusiness withal, fits it to every question.Look where she comes; you shall perceive herbehavior.
I have forgot it quite. The burden on ’t wasdown-a down-a, and penned by no worse manthan Geraldo, Emilia’s schoolmaster. He’s as fantastical,too, as ever he may go upon ’s legs, for inthe next world will Dido see Palamon, and thenwill she be out of love with Aeneas.
What stuff’s here?Poor soul.
E’en thus all day long.
Now for this charm that I told you of, youmust bring a piece of silver on the tip of yourtongue, or no ferry; then if it be your chance tocome where the blessed spirits are, there’s asight now! We maids that have our livers perished,cracked to pieces with love, we shall come there,and do nothing all day long but pick flowers withProserpine. Then will I make Palamon a nosegay;then let him mark me then.
How prettily she’s amiss! Note her a littlefurther.
Faith, I’ll tell you, sometime we go tobarley-break, we of the blessed. Alas, ’tis a sore lifethey have i’ th’ other place—such burning, frying,boiling, hissing, howling, chatt’ring, cursing—O,they have shrewd measure, take heed! If one bemad, or hang or drown themselves, thither theygo, Jupiter bless us, and there shall we be put ina cauldron of lead and usurers’ grease, amongst awhole million of cutpurses, and there boil like agammon of bacon that will never be enough.
How her brains coins!
Lords and courtiers that have got maidswith child, they are in this place. They shall standin fire up to the navel and in ice up to th’ heart, andthere th’ offending part burns and the deceivingpart freezes: in troth, a very grievous punishment,as one would think, for such a trifle. Believe me,one would marry a leprous witch to be rid on ’t, I’llassure you.
How she continues this fancy! ’Tis not an engraffedmadness, but a most thick and profoundmelancholy.
To hear there a proud lady and a proud citywife howl together—I were a beast an I’d call itgood sport. One cries O this smoke! th’ other,This fire!; one cries, O, that ever I did it behindthe arras! and then howls; th’ other curses a suingfellow and her garden house.I will be true, my stars, my fate, etc.
What think you of her, sir?
I think she has a perturbed mind, which Icannot minister to.
Alas, what then?
Understand you she ever affected any manere she beheld Palamon?
I was once, sir, in great hope she had fixed herliking on this gentleman, my friend.
I did think so, too, and would account I had agreat penn’orth on ’t to give half my state that bothshe and I, at this present, stood unfeignedly on thesame terms.
That intemp’rate surfeit of her eye hath distemperedthe other senses. They may return andsettle again to execute their preordained faculties,but they are now in a most extravagant vagary.This you must do: confine her to a place wherethe light may rather seem to steal in than bepermitted.—Take upon you, young sir, her friend,the name of Palamon; say you come to eat withher, and to commune of love. This will catch herattention, for this her mind beats upon; otherobjects that are inserted ’tween her mind and eyebecome the pranks and friskins of her madness.Sing to her such green songs of love as she saysPalamon hath sung in prison. Come to her stuckin as sweet flowers as the season is mistress of,and thereto make an addition of some other compoundedodors which are grateful to the sense.All this shall become Palamon, for Palamon cansing, and Palamon is sweet and ev’ry good thing.Desire to eat with her, carve her, drink to her, andstill among intermingle your petition of grace andacceptance into her favor. Learn what maids havebeen her companions and playferes, and let themrepair to her with Palamon in their mouths, andappear with tokens, as if they suggested for him.—It is a falsehood she is in, which is with falsehoodsto be combated. This may bring her to eat,to sleep, and reduce what’s now out of square inher into their former law and regiment. I have seenit approved, how many times I know not, but tomake the number more, I have great hope in this.I will between the passages of this project comein with my appliance. Let us put it in executionand hasten the success, which doubt not will bringforth comfort.
Now let ’em enter and before the godsTender their holy prayers. Let the templesBurn bright with sacred fires, and the altarsIn hallowed clouds commend their swelling incenseTo those above us. Let no due be wanting.They have a noble work in hand will honorThe very powers that love ’em.
Sir, they enter.
You valiant and strong-hearted enemies,You royal german foes, that this day comeTo blow that nearness out that flames between you,Lay by your anger for an hour and, dove-like,Before the holy altars of your helpers,The all-feared gods, bow down your stubbornbodies.Your ire is more than mortal; so your help be.And as the gods regard you, fight with justice.I’ll leave you to your prayers, and betwixt youI part my wishes.
Honor crown the worthiest!
The glass is running now that cannot finishTill one of us expire. Think you but thus,That were there aught in me which strove to showMine enemy in this business, were ’t one eyeAgainst another, arm oppressed by arm,I would destroy th’ offender, coz—I wouldThough parcel of myself. Then from this gatherHow I should tender you.
I am in laborTo push your name, your ancient love, our kindredOut of my memory, and i’ th’ selfsame placeTo seat something I would confound. So hoist weThe sails that must these vessels port even whereThe heavenly Limiter pleases.
You speak well.Before I turn, let me embrace thee, cousin.This I shall never do again.
One farewell.
Why, let it be so. Farewell, coz.
Farewell, sir.Knights, kinsmen, lovers, yea, my sacrifices,True worshippers of Mars, whose spirit in youExpels the seeds of fear and th’ apprehensionWhich still is father of it, go with meBefore the god of our profession. ThereRequire of him the hearts of lions andThe breath of tigers, yea, the fierceness too,Yea, the speed also—to go on, I mean;Else wish we to be snails. You know my prizeMust be dragged out of blood; force and great featMust put my garland on, where she sticks,The queen of flowers. Our intercession, then,Must be to him that makes the camp a cisternBrimmed with the blood of men. Give me your aid,And bend your spirits towards him.Thou mighty one, that with thy power hast turnedGreen Neptune into purple, whose approachComets prewarn, whose havoc in vast fieldUnearthèd skulls proclaim, whose breath blowsdownThe teeming Ceres’ foison, who dost pluckWith hand armipotent from forth blue cloudsThe masoned turrets, that both mak’st and break’stThe stony girths of cities; me thy pupil,Youngest follower of thy drum, instruct this dayWith military skill, that to thy laudI may advance my streamer, and by theeBe styled the lord o’ th’ day. Give me, great Mars,Some token of thy pleasure.O, great corrector of enormous times,Shaker of o’er-rank states, thou grand deciderOf dusty and old titles, that heal’st with bloodThe Earth when it is sick, and cur’st the worldO’ th’ pleurisy of people, I do takeThy signs auspiciously, and in thy nameTo my design march boldly.—Let us go.
Our stars must glister with new fire, or beToday extinct. Our argument is love,Which, if the goddess of it grant, she givesVictory too. Then blend your spirits with mine,You whose free nobleness do make my causeYour personal hazard. To the goddess VenusCommend we our proceeding, and imploreHer power unto our party.Hail, sovereign queen of secrets, who hast powerTo call the fiercest tyrant from his rageAnd weep unto a girl; that hast the mightEven with an eye-glance to choke Mars’s drumAnd turn th’ alarm to whispers; that canst makeA cripple flourish with his crutch, and cure himBefore Apollo; that mayst force the kingTo be his subject’s vassal, and induceStale gravity to dance. The polled bachelor,Whose youth, like wanton boys through bonfires,Have skipped thy flame, at seventy thou canst catch,And make him, to the scorn of his hoarse throat,Abuse young lays of love. What godlike powerHast thou not power upon? To Phoebus thouAdd’st flames hotter than his; the heavenly firesDid scorch his mortal son, thine him. The huntress,All moist and cold, some say, began to throwHer bow away and sigh. Take to thy graceMe, thy vowed soldier, who do bear thy yokeAs ’twere a wreath of roses, yet is heavierThan lead itself, stings more than nettles.I have never been foul-mouthed against thy law,Ne’er revealed secret, for I knew none—would not,Had I kenned all that were. I never practicedUpon man’s wife, nor would the libels readOf liberal wits. I never at great feastsSought to betray a beauty, but have blushedAt simp’ring sirs that did. I have been harshTo large confessors, and have hotly asked themIf they had mothers—I had one, a woman,And women ’twere they wronged. I knew a manOf eighty winters—this I told them—whoA lass of fourteen brided; ’twas thy powerTo put life into dust. The agèd crampHad screwed his square foot round;The gout had knit his fingers into knots;Torturing convulsions from his globy eyesHad almost drawn their spheres, that what was lifeIn him seemed torture. This anatomyHad by his young fair fere a boy, and IBelieved it was his, for she swore it was,And who would not believe her? Brief, I amTo those that prate and have done, no companion;To those that boast and have not, a defier;To those that would and cannot, a rejoicer.Yea, him I do not love that tells close officesThe foulest way, nor names concealments inThe boldest language. Such a one I am,And vow that lover never yet made sighTruer than I. O, then, most soft sweet goddess,Give me the victory of this question, whichIs true love’s merit, and bless me with a signOf thy great pleasure.O thou that from eleven to ninety reign’stIn mortal bosoms, whose chase is this worldAnd we in herds thy game, I give thee thanksFor this fair token, which being laid untoMine innocent true heart, arms in assuranceMy body to this business.—Let us riseAnd bow before the goddess.Time comes on.
O sacred, shadowy, cold, and constant queen,Abandoner of revels, mute contemplative,Sweet, solitary, white as chaste, and pureAs wind-fanned snow, who to thy female knightsAllow’st no more blood than will make a blush,Which is their order’s robe, I here, thy priest,Am humbled ’fore thine altar. O, vouchsafeWith that thy rare green eye, which never yetBeheld thing maculate, look on thy virgin,And, sacred silver mistress, lend thine ear—Which ne’er heard scurrile term, into whose portNe’er entered wanton sound—to my petition,Seasoned with holy fear. This is my lastOf vestal office. I am bride-habitedBut maiden-hearted. A husband I have ’pointed,But do not know him. Out of two I shouldChoose one, and pray for his success, but IAm guiltless of election. Of mine eyes,Were I to lose one—they are equal precious—I could doom neither; that which perished shouldGo to ’t unsentenced. Therefore, most modest queen,He of the two pretenders that best loves meAnd has the truest title in ’t, let himTake off my wheaten garland, or else grantThe file and quality I hold I mayContinue in thy band.See what our general of ebbs and flowsOut from the bowels of her holy altarWith sacred act advances: but one rose.If well inspired, this battle shall confoundBoth these brave knights, and I, a virgin flower,Must grow alone unplucked.The flower is fall’n, the tree descends. O mistress,Thou here dischargest me. I shall be gathered;I think so, but I know not thine own will.Unclasp thy mystery!—I hope she’s pleased;Her signs were gracious.
Has this advice I told you done any good upon her?
O, very much. The maids that kept her companyHave half-persuaded her that I am Palamon;Within this half-hour she came smiling to me,And asked me what I would eat, and when I wouldkiss her.I told her Presently, and kissed her twice.
’Twas well done; twenty times had been far better,For there the cure lies mainly.
Then she told meShe would watch with me tonight, for well she knewWhat hour my fit would take me.
Let her do so,And when your fit comes, fit her home,And presently.
She would have me sing.
You did so?
No.
’Twas very ill done, then.You should observe her ev’ry way.
Alas,I have no voice, sir, to confirm her that way.
That’s all one, if you make a noise.If she entreat again, do anything.Lie with her, if she ask you.
Ho there, doctor!
Yes, in the way of cure.
But first, by your leave,I’ th’ way of honesty.
That’s but a niceness.Ne’er cast your child away for honesty.Cure her first this way; then if she will be honest,She has the path before her.
Thank you, doctor.
Pray bring her inAnd let’s see how she is.
I will, and tell herHer Palamon stays for her. But, doctor,Methinks you are i’ th’ wrong still.
Go, go.You fathers are fine fools. Her honesty?And we should give her physic till we find that!
Why, do you think she is not honest, sir?
How old is she?
She’s eighteen.
She may be.But that’s all one; ’tis nothing to our purpose.Whate’er her father says, if you perceiveHer mood inclining that way that I spoke of,Videlicet, the way of flesh—you have me?
Yes, very well, sir.
Please her appetite,And do it home; it cures her, ipso facto,The melancholy humor that infects her.
I am of your mind, doctor.
You’ll find it so.She comes; pray humor her.
Come, your love Palamon stays for you, child,And has done this long hour, to visit you.
I thank him for his gentle patience.He’s a kind gentleman, and I am much bound tohim.Did you ne’er see the horse he gave me?
Yes.
How do you like him?
He’s a very fair one.
You never saw him dance?
No.
I have, often.He dances very finely, very comely,And for a jig, come cut and long tail to him,He turns you like a top.
That’s fine indeed.
He’ll dance the morris twenty mile an hour,And that will founder the best hobbyhorse,If I have any skill, in all the parish,And gallops to the tune of Light o’ love.What think you of this horse?
Having these virtues,I think he might be brought to play at tennis.
Alas, that’s nothing.
Can he write and read too?
A very fair hand, and casts himself th’ accountsOf all his hay and provender. That hostlerMust rise betime that cozens him. You knowThe chestnut mare the Duke has?
Very well.
She is horribly in love with him, poor beast,But he is like his master, coy and scornful.
What dowry has she?
Some two hundred bottles,And twenty strike of oats, but he’ll ne’er have her.He lisps in ’s neighing able to enticeA miller’s mare. He’ll be the death of her.
What stuff she utters!
Make curtsy; here your love comes.
Pretty soul,How do you?That’s a fine maid; there’s a curtsy!
Yours to command i’ th’ way of honesty.—How far is ’t now to th’ end o’ th’ world, my masters?
Why, a day’s journey, wench.
Will you go with me?
What shall we do there, wench?
Why, play atstool-ball.What is there else to do?
I am content,If we shall keep our wedding there.
’Tis true,For there, I will assure you, we shall findSome blind priest for the purpose, that will ventureTo marry us; for here they are nice and foolish.Besides, my father must be hanged tomorrow,And that would be a blot i’ th’ business.Are not you Palamon?
Do not you know me?
Yes, but you care not for me; I have nothingBut this poor petticoat and two coarse smocks.
That’s all one; I will have you.
Will you surely?
Yes, by this fair hand, will I.
We’ll to bed then.
E’en when you will.
O, sir, you would fainbe nibbling.
Why do you rub my kiss off?
’Tis a sweet one,And will perfume me finely against the wedding.Is not this your cousin Arcite?
Yes, sweetheart,And I am glad my cousin PalamonHas made so fair a choice.
Do you think he’ll have me?
Yes, without doubt.
Do you think so too?
Yes.
We shall have many children. Lord,how you’re grown!My Palamon, I hope, will grow too, finely,Now he’s at liberty. Alas, poor chicken,He was kept down with hard meat and ill lodging,But I’ll kiss him up again.
What do you here? You’ll lose the noblest sightThat e’er was seen.
Are they i’ th’ field?
They are.You bear a charge there too.
I’ll away straight.—I must e’en leave you here.
Nay, we’ll go with you.I will not lose the sight.
How did you like her?
I’ll warrant you, within these three or four daysI’ll make her right again.You must not from her,But still preserve her in this way.
I will.
Let’s get her in.
Come, sweet, we’ll go to dinnerAnd then we’ll play at cards.
And shall we kiss too?
A hundred times.
And twenty.
Ay, and twenty.
And then we’ll sleep together.
Take her offer.
Yes, marry, will we.
But you shall not hurt me.
I will not, sweet.
If you do, love, I’ll cry.
I’ll no step further.
Will you lose this sight?
I had rather see a wren hawk at a flyThan this decision; ev’ry blow that fallsThreats a brave life; each stroke lamentsThe place whereon it falls, and sounds more likeA bell than blade. I will stay here.It is enough my hearing shall be punishedWith what shall happen, ’gainst the which there isNo deafing but to hear; not taint mine eyeWith dread sights it may shun.
Sir, my good lord,Your sister will no further.
O, she must.She shall see deeds of honor in their kind,Which sometime show well, penciled. Nature nowShall make and act the story, the beliefBoth sealed with eye and ear.—You must be present;You are the victor’s meed, the price and garlandTo crown the question’s title.
Pardon me.If I were there, I’d wink.
You must be there;This trial is as ’twere i’ th’ night, and youThe only star to shine.
I am extinct;There is but envy in that light which showsThe one the other. Darkness, which ever wasThe dam of horror, who does stand accursedOf many mortal millions, may even now,By casting her black mantle over both,That neither could find other, get herselfSome part of a good name, and many a murderSet off whereto she’s guilty.
You must go.
In faith, I will not.
Why, the knights must kindleTheir valor at your eye. Know, of this warYou are the treasure, and must needs be byTo give the service pay.
Sir, pardon me.The title of a kingdom may be triedOut of itself.
Well, well, then; at your pleasure.Those that remain with you could wish their officeTo any of their enemies.
Farewell, sister.I am like to know your husband ’fore yourselfBy some small start of time. He whom the godsDo of the two know best, I pray them heBe made your lot.
Arcite is gently visaged, yet his eyeIs like an engine bent, or a sharp weaponIn a soft sheath; mercy and manly courageAre bedfellows in his visage. PalamonHas a most menacing aspect; his browIs graved, and seems to bury what it frowns on;Yet sometimes ’tis not so, but alters toThe quality of his thoughts. Long time his eyeWill dwell upon his object. MelancholyBecomes him nobly; so does Arcite’s mirth;But Palamon’s sadness is a kind of mirth,So mingled, as if mirth did make him sadAnd sadness merry. Those darker humors thatStick misbecomingly on others, on themLive in fair dwelling.Hark how yon spurs to spirit do inciteThe princes to their proof! Arcite may win me,And yet may Palamon wound Arcite toThe spoiling of his figure. O, what pityEnough for such a chance? If I were by,I might do hurt, for they would glance their eyesTowards my seat, and in that motion mightOmit a ward or forfeit an offenseWhich craved that very time.It is much betterI am not there. O, better never bornThan minister to such harm!What is the chance?
The cry’s À Palamon.
Then he has won. ’Twas ever likely.He looked all grace and success, and he isDoubtless the prim’st of men. I prithee runAnd tell me how it goes.
Still Palamon.
Run and inquire.Poor servant, thou hastlost.Upon my right side still I wore thy picture,Palamon’s on the left—why so, I know not.I had no end in ’t else; chance would have it so.On the sinister side the heart lies; PalamonHad the best-boding chance.This burst of clamorIs sure th’ end o’ th’ combat.
They said that Palamon had Arcite’s bodyWithin an inch o’ th’ pyramid, that the cryWas general À Palamon. But anon,Th’ assistants made a brave redemption, andThe two bold titlers at this instant areHand to hand at it.
Were they metamorphosedBoth into one—O, why, there were no womanWorth so composed a man! Their single share,Their nobleness peculiar to them, givesThe prejudice of disparity, value’s shortness,To any lady breathing.More exulting?Palamon still?
Nay, now the sound is Arcite.
I prithee lay attention to the cry;Set both thine ears to th’ business.
The cry is ArciteAnd Victory! Hark, Arcite, victory!The combat’s consummation is proclaimedBy the wind instruments.
Half-sights sawThat Arcite was no babe. God’s lid, his richnessAnd costliness of spirit looked through him; it couldNo more be hid in him than fire in flax,Than humble banks can go to law with watersThat drift-winds force to raging. I did thinkGood Palamon would miscarry, yet I knew notWhy I did think so. Our reasons are not prophetsWhen oft our fancies are. They are coming off.Alas, poor Palamon!
Lo, where our sister is in expectation,Yet quaking and unsettled.—Fairest Emily,The gods by their divine arbitramentHave given you this knight; he is a good oneAs ever struck at head.—Give me your hands.Receive you her, you him. Be plighted withA love that grows as you decay.
Emily,To buy you I have lost what’s dearest to meSave what is bought, and yet I purchase cheaply,As I do rate your value.
O loved sister,He speaks now of as brave a knight as e’erDid spur a noble steed. Surely the godsWould have him die a bachelor, lest his raceShould show i’ th’ world too godlike. His behaviorSo charmed me that methought Alcides wasTo him a sow of lead. If I could praiseEach part of him to th’ all I have spoke, your ArciteDid not lose by ’t, for he that was thus goodEncountered yet his better. I have heardTwo emulous Philomels beat the ear o’ th’ nightWith their contentious throats, now one the higher,Anon the other, then again the first,And by-and-by out-breasted, that the senseCould not be judge between ’em. So it faredGood space between these kinsmen, till heavens didMake hardly one the winner.—Wear the garlandWith joy that you have won.—For the subdued,Give them our present justice, since I knowTheir lives but pinch ’em. Let it here be done.The scene’s not for our seeing. Go we henceRight joyful, with some sorrow.—Arm your prize;I know you will not lose her.—Hippolyta,I see one eye of yours conceives a tear,The which it will deliver.
Is this winning?O all you heavenly powers, where is your mercy?But that your wills have said it must be so,And charge me live to comfort this unfriended,This miserable prince, that cuts awayA life more worthy from him than all women,I should and would die too.
Infinite pityThat four such eyes should be so fixed on oneThat two must needs be blind for ’t.
So it is.
There’s many a man alive that hath outlivedThe love o’ th’ people; yea, i’ th’ selfsame stateStands many a father with his child. Some comfortWe have by so considering. We expire,And not without men’s pity. To live still,Have their good wishes; we preventThe loathsome misery of age, beguileThe gout and rheum that in lag hours attendFor gray approachers; we come towards the godsYoung and unwappered, not halting under crimesMany and stale. That sure shall please the godsSooner than such, to give us nectar with ’em,For we are more clear spirits. My dear kinsmen,Whose lives for this poor comfort are laid down,You have sold ’em too too cheap.
What ending could beOf more content? O’er us the victors haveFortune, whose title is as momentaryAs to us death is certain. A grain of honorThey not o’er-weigh us.
Let us bid farewell;And with our patience anger tott’ring Fortune,Who at her certain’st reels.
Come, who begins?
E’en he that led you to this banquet shallTaste to you all. Ah ha, my friend, myfriend,Your gentle daughter gave me freedom once;You’ll see ’t done now forever. Pray, how does she?I heard she was not well; her kind of illGave me some sorrow.
Sir, she’s well restored,And to be married shortly.
By my short life,I am most glad on ’t. ’Tis the latest thingI shall be glad of; prithee, tell her so.Commend me to her, and to piece her portion,Tender her this.
Nay, let’s be offerers all.
Is it a maid?
Verily, I think so.A right good creature, more to me deservingThan I can quit or speak of.
Commend us to her.
The gods requite you all and make her thankful!
Adieu, and let my life be now as shortAs my leave-taking.
Lead, courageous cousin.
We’ll follow cheerfully.
Hold, hold! O, hold, hold, hold!
Hold, ho! It is a cursèd haste you madeIf you have done so quickly!—Noble Palamon,The gods will show their glory in a lifeThat thou art yet to lead.
Can that be,When Venus, I have said, is false? How do thingsfare?
Arise, great sir, and give the tidings earThat are most dearly sweet and bitter.
WhatHath waked us from our dream?
List then: yourcousin,Mounted upon a steed that EmilyDid first bestow on him—a black one, owingNot a hair worth of white, which some will sayWeakens his price, and many will not buyHis goodness with this note, which superstitionHere finds allowance—on this horse is ArciteTrotting the stones of Athens—which the calkinsDid rather tell than trample, for the horseWould make his length a mile, if ’t pleased his riderTo put pride in him. As he thus went countingThe flinty pavement, dancing, as ’twere, to th’ musicHis own hooves made—for, as they say, from ironCame music’s origin—what envious flint,Cold as old Saturn, and like him possessedWith fire malevolent, darted a spark,Or what fierce sulphur else, to this end made,I comment not; the hot horse, hot as fire,Took toy at this and fell to what disorderHis power could give his will; bounds, comes on end,Forgets school-doing, being therein trainedAnd of kind manage. Pig-like he whinesAt the sharp rowel, which he frets at ratherThan any jot obeys; seeks all foul meansOf boist’rous and rough jadery to disseatHis lord that kept it bravely. When naught served,When neither curb would crack, girth break, nordiff’ring plungesDisroot his rider whence he grew, but thatHe kept him ’tween his legs, on his hind hoofsOn end he standsThat Arcite’s legs, being higher than his head,Seemed with strange art to hang. His victor’s wreathEven then fell off his head, and presentlyBackward the jade comes o’er, and his full poiseBecomes the rider’s load. Yet is he living,But such a vessel ’tis that floats but forThe surge that next approaches. He much desiresTo have some speech with you. Lo, he appears.
O, miserable end of our alliance!The gods are mighty, Arcite. If thy heart,Thy worthy, manly heart, be yet unbroken,Give me thy last words. I am Palamon,One that yet loves thee dying.
Take EmiliaAnd with her all the world’s joy. Reach thy hand;Farewell. I have told my last hour. I was false,Yet never treacherous. Forgive me, cousin.One kiss from fair Emilia.’Tis done.Take her. I die.
Thy brave soul seek Elysium!
I’ll close thine eyes, prince. Blessed souls be withthee!Thou art a right good man, and while I live,This day I give to tears.
And I to honor.
In this place first you fought; e’en very hereI sundered you. Acknowledge to the godsOur thanks that you are living.His part is played, and though it were too short,He did it well. Your day is lengthened, andThe blissful dew of heaven does arrouse you.The powerful Venus well hath graced her altar,And given you your love. Our master, Mars,Hath vouched his oracle, and to Arcite gaveThe grace of the contention. So the deitiesHave showed due justice.—Bear this hence.
O cousin,That we should things desire which do cost usThe loss of our desire, that naught could buyDear love but loss of dear love.
Never FortuneDid play a subtler game. The conquered triumphs;The victor has the loss; yet in the passageThe gods have been most equal.—Palamon,Your kinsman hath confessed the right o’ th’ ladyDid lie in you, for you first saw her andEven then proclaimed your fancy. He restored herAs your stol’n jewel and desired your spiritTo send him hence forgiven. The gods my justiceTake from my hand and they themselves becomeThe executioners. Lead your lady off,And call your lovers from the stage of death,Whom I adopt my friends. A day or twoLet us look sadly, and give grace untoThe funeral of Arcite, in whose endThe visages of bridegrooms we’ll put onAnd smile with Palamon—for whom an hour,But one hour since, I was as dearly sorryAs glad of Arcite, and am now as gladAs for him sorry. O you heavenly charmers,What things you make of us! For what we lackWe laugh, for what we have are sorry, stillAre children in some kind. Let us be thankfulFor that which is, and with you leave disputeThat are above our question. Let’s go offAnd bear us like the time.
I would now ask you how you like the play,But, as it is with schoolboys, cannot say.I am cruel fearful! Pray yet, stay a while,And let me look upon you. No man smile?Then it goes hard, I see. He that hasLoved a young handsome wench, then, show hisface—’Tis strange if none be here—and, if he will,Against his conscience let him hiss and killOur market. ’Tis in vain, I see, to stay you.Have at the worst can come, then! Now what sayyou?And yet mistake me not: I am not bold.We have no such cause. If the tale we have told—For ’tis no other—any way content you—For to that honest purpose it was meant you—We have our end; and you shall have ere long,I dare say, many a better, to prolongYour old loves to us. We, and all our might,Rest at your service. Gentlemen, good night.
